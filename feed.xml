<p><em>We spoke to CivicActioner Daniel Mundra, Associate Director of Drupal, about
the benefits of Drupal, community contributions, and why working at
CivicActions has been so rewarding for him . He is among a team of 60+ Drupal
engineers with nearly 20 Acquia certifications and 20+ edX a11y
(Accessibility) certifications.</em></p>

<p><strong>CivicActions is known for our Drupal expertise. To you, why is Drupal such
an important tool in the work that we do for our government clients?</strong></p>

<p>Drupal is a complex tool but it is the best tool to help deliver complex
concepts for our government clients. Drupal also delivers for our clients
while still being free, open source, having a growing community, and also not
afraid to change/adapt. I don't believe other similar products could check all
those boxes.</p>

<p>I have been working with Drupal for 12+ years, first with Drupal version 6 and
now with 10. Since my early days, Drupal has been a veritable Swiss army knife
for web development. It helped me deliver a lot of value to users in a quick
amount of time. Earlier I would produce many sites with a lot of modules but
not consider the maintenance costs, reliability you get with writing tests,
giving back to the community, and so on. It left my clients with a functional
site but a maintenance burden. Nowadays I focus more on contributing back,
writing more tests, reducing maintenance burden and thinking of long term
solutions than quicker output of sites. Just like how the Drupal platform and
community has evolved, so have I. Drupal has given me the space to do that and
I am grateful for that.</p>

<p><strong>What are some community contributions to Drupal from your team that you are
especially proud of?</strong></p>

<p>CivicActions contributes quite a bit to Drupal. Last year CivicActions was
credited with contributing 90+ contributions and that is only growing. I am
particularly proud of the modules we are adding to the community, like <a href="https://medium.com/civicactions/improving-
centers-for-medicare-and-medicaid-services-cms-through-drupal-contributions-
adb4f91f6095">Media
Link Enhancements (from Cameron Prince), Google Programmable Search JSON API
(from Timo Zura and Sam Lerner)</a>, and recently Content Model Documentation (from Steve Wirt).</p>

<p><strong>You are very passionate about accessibility — why is accessibility so
important to you and how do you work to make projects more accessible at
CivicActions?</strong></p>

<p>Accessibility is important to me because to truly be human centered we have to
make technology accessible to all. The primary ways I work to make projects
more accessible is by first building from the beginning with accessibility in
mind. The second way is to add layers of accessibility testing to ensure the
site remains accessible. Layers like automated testing, manual testing with
keyboards/screen readers, and testing with disabled users (when possible).
Accessibility is a long term commitment and I can say that at CivicActions we
are all contributing to that and we are making a difference.</p>

<p><strong>What initially drew you to a career in civic tech, particularly at
CivicActions?</strong></p>

<p>After spending 10 years working in higher education, in particular as an in-
house developer for the University of Oregon, I wanted a change. As the
university was going away from in-house development, I wanted to continue
growing my skills while still supporting similar mission-driven organizations.
I found both at CivicActions.</p>

<p><strong>What is the most rewarding part of your job?</strong></p>

<p>Being able to give back to the community and also take part in the company
outside of the project. I am an associate director now but I wouldn't have
been able to reach that role without the support of everyone at CivicActions.
They made space for me to take part in company activities like OKRs, guidebook
updates, accessibility practice area, and so on. I am successful because of
the culture of the team to make space and make most parts of the company
accessible to discussion, debate and continuous improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Any advice for someone looking to follow a similar career trajectory?</strong></p>

<p>Ask questions and get involved where you can, either at the company you work
for or in your local community. Find that company and community that energizes
you and bring your whole self to them.</p>

<p><strong>On a lighter note, what is a fun fact that people may not know about you?</strong></p>

<p>I like statistics so much that for 3 years I was the official statistician for
the Oregon Cricket League. Lots of data entry and review but I was able to see
how local players and teams evolved.</p>

disability") and identity-first language ("disabled person"). We recognize
both are valid and advocated for within the disability community.</em></p>

<p>"We lost our vision due to our service…my vision gets blurry," says a Veteran
over Zoom during a user research session.</p>

<p>We were testing new designs for a web-based app helping Veterans check into a
medical appointment.</p>

<p>This Veteran's experience is not uncommon: about 30% of Veterans live with a
disability (but that number is likely much higher due to military culture).
Almost 7,000 Veterans become newly blind or visually impaired every year. And
disabilities can vary in type and severity — the most common of which include
hearing loss, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), scars, back and neck
pain, and migraines.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-

Veteran waiting to be seen." /> <em>Figure 1: A few

their appointment. The Veteran waits until called in.</em></p>

<h3 id="checking-into-a-medical-appointment-with-a-smartphone-has-barriers">Checking into a medical appointment with a smartphone has barriers</h3>

<p>For example, it requires a Veteran to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Own a phone (or have access to one)</li>
  <li>See the check-in poster at the facility</li>
  <li>Have reasonable tech-savviness to use SMS or a QR code</li>
  <li>Understand the steps within a reasonably short time-frame (which can be difficult for some Veterans with cognitive disability or PTSD)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>We wanted to design digital and non-digital solutions that helped make it
more usable for disabled Veterans to check into medical appointments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But we had a lot of questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are we able to design for the range of types and severity of disabilities?</li>
  <li>Would some solutions only benefit some Veterans, while introducing barriers to others?</li>
  <li>How do we decide on those trade-offs?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="we-created-an-accessibility-use-case-map">We created an Accessibility Use Case Map</h3>

<p>An accessibility use case map is a framework to evaluate proposed solutions
across multiple different types of disabilities affecting Veterans. We
considered both digital and non-digital solutions for each phase of the check-
in process.</p>

<h4 id="a-spreadsheet-makes-it-accessible">A spreadsheet makes it accessible</h4>

<p>As we note later in the article, we worked with an accessibility specialist
who uses a screen-reader. We chose to design the map in a spreadsheet. This
made it easy for our colleague to offer feedback.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-
images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xmkO7Ni9XiAQx7kzofTTVw.png" alt="Example of accessibility use case map in a spreadsheet. Solutions are listed
along the x-axis: Receives email notification with link to check-in and Uses a
large-print poster with instructions to get the SMS link on how to check-in.
All nine disabilities are listed on the y-axis: blind, low vision, hard of
hearing, deaf, cognitive disabilities, post-traumatic stress disorder, motor
disabilities, military sexual trauma. Each solution is assessed for degree of
impact, which we discuss later." /> <em>Figure 3: Example
of accessibility use case map. Solutions are indicated on the x-axis. All nine
disabilities are listed on the y-axis. Each solution is assessed for degree of
impact: impactful, helpful, it depends, not relevant, and inaccessible. This
criteria is discussed later in this article.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We wanted our map to help prioritize solutions that maximized benefits for
Veterans living with a variety of disabilities, while minimizing the chances
of introducing barriers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's how we created the accessibility use case map.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-developed-proto-personas-for-each-type-of-disability">Step 1: Developed proto-personas for each type of disability</h3>

<p>We chose nine of the most common types of disabilities reported by Veterans:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blindness</li>
  <li>Low vision</li>
  <li>Hard of hearing/deafness</li>
  <li>Cognitive disability</li>
  <li>PTSD</li>
  <li>Motor disabilities</li>
  <li>Military Sexual Trauma (MST)</li>
  <li>Deafblindness</li>
</ul>

<p>Time and resources were limited. So we used secondary sources and "best
estimates" to develop light-weight personas of each disability type ( <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persona-
types/#:~:text=Proto%20personas%20are%20a%20lightweight,are%20and%20what%20they%20want.">proto-
personas</a>).
Each described the behavior, symptoms, needs, and tools used to manage the
condition. This allows for quicker, iterative research.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-
images-1.medium.com/max/799/1*GXQWKpmeWZWcyamh308OuA.png" alt="A proto-persona example: Olivia, who lives with low vision for several
years. She is in her early 40s. She lives in a rural area and spends time
planning. She relies on screen readers, magnifier, voice apps, and large
prints. She is concerned about keeping her costs low, so she prefers to attend
all of her appointments in one day. Examples of Olivia's behaviors and needs
and challenges are provided in post-it notes, but are purposely not
legible." /> <em>Figure 4: Example
of a proto-persona for a Veteran living with low-vision. We used secondary
research sources to validate our assumptions on behaviors, needs and
challenges. Details of the post-it notes are intentionally not-visible, and
are shown for example purposes only.</em></p>

<h3 id="step-2-created-user-journey-maps-to-identify-pain-points-and-possible-solutions">Step 2: Created user journey maps to identify pain points and possible solutions</h3>

<p>Based on the proto-personas, we created user journey maps across the medical
appointment experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before checking into an appointment</li>
  <li>During the appointment, and;</li>
  <li>After the appointment</li>
</ul>

<p>We proposed solutions to help address pain points across the journey for each
type of disability.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-
images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*q1pVA7nHUfRTp1gd5oTWlA.png" alt="Example of user journey map for a Veteran with a low-vision disability. The
X axis lists user behaviors: actions, thoughts, pain points, touchpoints,
feelings, opportunities. The Y axis lists phases of the check-in experience:
before visit, before arrival, check-in on day of appointment, during the
appointment, the following appointment, after visit. Purple, green and blue
post-it notes appear along the map. The text is intentionally not visible as
this is for example purposes only." /> <em>Figure 5: Example
of user journey map for a Veteran living with low vision and may need
caregiver support to prepare for the medical appointment. Details of the post-
it notes are intentionally not-visible, and are shown for example purposes
only.</em></p>

<h3 id="step-3-mapped-each-solution-across-multiple-disability-types-creating-our-accessibility-use-case-map">Step 3: Mapped each solution across multiple disability types, creating our accessibility use case map</h3>

<p>But what might benefit someone with one type of disability, might be a barrier
for others. For instance, text-to-speech software is helpful for a blind
Veteran trying to access their appointments. But it may be inaccessible to a
Veteran who is hard of hearing.</p>

<p>Due to this challenge, we decided to map each proposed solution across the 9
most common disabilities affecting Veterans.</p>

<p>We listed recommendations along the x-axis. We then listed the nine
disabilities along the y-axis.</p>

<p>For each type of disability, we assessed if the solution was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Impactful (positive and we believe will enhance the experience for this disability)</li>
  <li>Helpful (positive and it's not specific to this disability)</li>
  <li>It Depends (it may depend on the degree or type of disability, or the recommendation is too complex for us to weigh in at this point)</li>
  <li>Not Relevant</li>
  <li>Inaccessible (it's a barrier for a person with this disability)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-4-iterated-with-various-accessibility-experts">Step 4: Iterated with various accessibility experts</h3>

<p>Time constraints didn't allow us to validate with users (which would've been
ideal). Instead, we iterated on our map with various accessibility
specialists:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Josh Kim (Accessibility Designer)</li>
  <li>Martha Wilkes ( Accessibility Strategist at the VA Office of the Chief Technology Office)</li>
  <li>Melissa Manak (Senior User Experience Mobile Designer)</li>
  <li>Angela Fowler (Senior A11Y Specialist and Designer)</li>
  <li>Vanessa Luxen (an IAAP certified professional and former Audiologist at CivicActions)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the experts we consulted also lived with a disability. This helped
ensure we were including the lived experiences of the very people we were
designing for.</p>

<h3 id="step-5-developed-an-accessibility-impact-score-for-each-recommendation">Step 5: Developed an "Accessibility Impact Score" for each recommendation.</h3>

<p>Working with our accessibility experts, we assigned a value depending on how
helpful or unhelpful the solution was for each type of disability. We called
this our "Accessibility Impact Score."</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 for Impactful (positive and we believe will enhance the experience for this disability)</li>
  <li>2 for Helpful (positive and it is not specific to this disability)</li>
  <li>1 for It Depends (it may depend on the degree of type of disability, or the recommendation is too complex for us to weigh in at this point)</li>
  <li>0 for Not Relevant</li>
  <li>-2 for Inaccessible (it is a barrier for a person with this disability)</li>
</ul>

<p>We then tallied the number of scores for each solution to calculate the final
"Accessibility Impact Score."</p>

<p>This helped us assign a numerical value to evaluate the impact each
recommendation would have across multiple disabilities. For instance,
improvements like "sending an SMS notification with a link to pre-check-in"
was one of our highest impact solutions. This meant it was impactful for the
greatest number of disabilities.</p>

<h3 id="step-6-prioritized-recommendations-based-on-the-accessibility-impact-score">Step 6: Prioritized recommendations based on the Accessibility Impact Score</h3>

<p>Using a prioritization matrix, we prioritized each recommendation based on its
total Accessibility Impact Score.</p>

<p>We refined it further with our product team based on scope and feasibility, so
we could eventually choose the recommendations we wanted on our roadmap.</p>

<h3 id="we-took-some-risks-and-made-many-assumptions">We took some risks and made many assumptions</h3>

<p>There are many caveats with our framework, for instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It favors specific solutions that are impactful for a few disabilities and may end up with a lower score vs. general solutions that help a variety of disabilities.</li>
  <li>We did not capture the complexity within each disability type. For example, cognitive disabilities can include a range of disabilities that vary in severity, symptoms and more. We recognize disabilities are not a monolith and the experiences are complex and varied.</li>
  <li>It doesn't take user preferences or familiarity with the technology into account</li>
  <li>It's not intersectional — it doesn't consider people who live with more than one disability</li>
  <li>We didn't test it with users living with disabilities.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is our first attempt at designing for disabled Veterans when resources
are limited, time-frames are tight, and priorities conflict.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="ideally-disabled-veterans-would-be-part-of-our-process">Ideally, disabled Veterans would be part of our process</h4>

<p>What would we have done differently without those constraints? We would have
included disabled Veterans throughout all six steps of the process. This way
we'd design <em>with</em> (not <em>for</em> ) the disabled Veteran community.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What's next?</h3>

<p>This framework is dynamic. We plan to continue to iterate as we address our
many assumptions. We hope to start conducting user research sessions with
Veterans living with disabilities to validate (and invalidate) our proposed
improvements.</p>

Working with an open community has allowed us to pioneer some new solutions to common design challenges. Working in the open has allowed us to tap expertise outside of our community and given space for people with disabilities to become involved in a variety of roles. Accessibility best practices make it clear that accessibility needs to be considered at all levels of a project.</p>
