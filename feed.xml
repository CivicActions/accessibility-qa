temporary or situational disabilities.  According to the <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">WebAIM 2022 report</a> on the accessibility of the top million sites, 96.8% of home pages have 
accessibility failures.</p>

<p>CivicActions recognizes that the digital world is the operational hub for critical human services. By safeguarding and committing to an accessible digital future, we ensure more people can get the help they need, and service-providers can readily engage.</p>

<p>To continue to advance our accessibility maturity,  CivicActions has established the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to Accessibility as part of employee onboarding</li>
  <li>CivicActions Global Accessibility Community of Practice</li>
  <li>Free and Open Source Software Products, such as site-wide accessibility monitoring tools and the <a href="https://gsa.github.io/openacr-editor/">OpenACR</a> project.</li>
  <li>Inclusive agile development process</li>
  <li>Accessibility Champions Program</li>
  <li>Annual engagement in events like Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, we reaffirm our commitment to digital accessibility with this pledge.</p>

<p>CivicActions hereby pledges to build and maintain digital tools with the following guidelines.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Our work will be continuously monitored
    <ul>
      <li>Integrate best of breed accessibility testing into our continuous integration processes</li>
      <li>Ensure all developers and designers start using accessibility tools in their editors</li>
      <li>Automated site-wide testing and historical analysis will be used</li>
      <li>Site-wide test scores and improvement targets will be incorporated into agile process</li>
      <li>Manual testing will be done alongside automated testing to catch issues that automated testing cannot evaluate</li>
      <li>Testing with users with disabilities where possible to see that people with lived experience evaluate critical tasks</li>
      <li>Incorporate structured WCAG-EM evaluations into contractual annual reviews with our clients</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Upon onboarding, we will inform our teams, partners, and clients about why accessibility is important and set collective priorities
    <ul>
      <li>We will define and document success for accessibility in Human Centered Design, Customer Experiences and Section 508 compliance, among other priorities</li>
      <li>These agreed-to accessibility priorities will be incorporated into our Project Charters and regularly reviewed by our team</li>
      <li>We will have designated accessibility champions on all projects and work to have IAAP Certified and/or DHS 508 Certified staff</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As a company, CivicActions will set annual goals and report against them publicly on CivicActions.com/accessibility-reports (Future Location)
    <ul>
      <li>Strive for no accessibility errors as much as can be identified through our automated testing process</li>
      <li>Document process for choosing representative sample of pages for reviews</li>

The goal of this process is to help make accessibility conformance monitoring easier and more meaningful for everyone. You can more about this project on the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/open-product-accessibility-template">OPAT GitHub Project</a> and we are actively encouraging people to <a href="https://github.com/GSA/open-product-accessibility-template/issues">submit suggestions</a> on how it could be improved.</p>

<p>This project has several goals. We are working to build an Accessibility Conformance Report(ACR) that is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transparent</strong> - Easily comparable compliance reports.</li>
  <li><strong>Validatable</strong> - Confidence that reports meet minimum standards.</li>
  <li><strong>Aggregable</strong> - Enterprise-wide accessibility confidence.</li>
  <li><strong>Versioned</strong> - ACRs should follow digital best practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Modern ACRs need to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>machine-readable</li>
  <li>able to integrate with modern software development tools</li>
  <li>aligned with modern software versioning</li>
  <li>easily editable and comparable</li>
  <li>centrally updated and publicly available</li>
</ul>

<p>Our work with the GSA is helping set the foundation for this work.</p>]]></content><author><name>mike-gifford</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[CivicActions' contract with the GSA has allowed us to build a open Accessibility Conformance Report that is machine-readable Open Product Accessibility Template (OPAT).]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/card-power.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/card-power.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">CivicActions wins contract to produce a machine-readable Voluntary Product Accessibility Template® (VPAT®)</title><link href="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/posts/gsa-machine-readable-acr" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CivicActions wins contract to produce a machine-readable Voluntary Product Accessibility Template® (VPAT®)" /><published>2021-08-11T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-09-19T20:15:39+00:00</updated><id>https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/posts/gsa-machine-readable-acr</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/posts/gsa-machine-readable-acr"><![CDATA[<p>We're thrilled to be helping the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/">GSA</a> improve its digital accessibility by improving procurement! The standard Accessibility Compliance Report(ACR) for the last two decades has been the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template® (VPAT®).

<p>As <a href="https://etc.g2xchange.com/statics/civicactions-receives-contract-award-from-gsa-to-improve-digital-accessibility-of-compliance-reports/">announced on g2xchange</a> this process will move ACR from an essentially paper-based format to one that is in well structured digital files that can be validated.

<p>We tested against 2.1 AA requirements, the current best practice for digital accessibility standards. The open source tools we used were <a href="https://github.com/MSU-NatSci/DomainAccessibilityAudit">Domain Accessibility Audit</a> (to crawl the pages) and <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core">axe</a> (to perform the actual accessibility scans).</p>

<p>These problems are happening because accessibility has been an afterthought, even in government. In order for accessibility success to scale in the enterprise we need to take a more holistic approach. For this we have developed our <a href="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/heart">HEART</a> framework.</p>

<p>We value openness, agility, inclusiveness and continuous improvement. Ensuring that our site is consistently built makes it easier to maintain in the long-run.</p>

<p>As our website grows, we want to ensure our content mirrors our values — and that it scales with ease. So, we have enabled automated testing (and some updating) of text when it's submitted in a pull request.</p>

<h2 id="content-goals-that-match-our-values">Content goals that match our values</h2>

<p>It is important that this site demonstrates our values by being accessible and professional. That's why we eliminate unclear, insensitive language that could alienate our audience.</p>

<p>Automation is not full-proof. It doesn't have context to understand why a sentence is structured a certain way or why particular words are used. It is a tool in our arsenal to help us continuously improve, like catching terms that might be offensive or simplifying complex sentences, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="the-technology">The technology</h2>

<p>Most content changes are done through plain text editors or directly on GitHub. So, many of the conveniences that are built into modern word processing applications aren't available. The following tools help us keep the quality of our site high.</p>

<p>To achieve the testing we use the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/remarkjs/remark">remark</a>: A markdown processor (Markdown is how we write all our content that is then compiled into static HTML pages by Jekyll).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/retextjs/retext">retext</a>: A natural language processor to check for issues in the text.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog">reviewdog</a>: Takes the errors and warnings from remark and retext and comments on the markdown text in the code (pull request) indicating the issues and recommended corrections.</li>
  <li><a href="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit</a>: Also test files for any issues and in some cases updates the text automatically.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>: Used to run the reviewdog scripts with remark and retext whenever a pull request is submitted.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-setup">The setup</h2>

<p>For remark/retext we create a Docker image that installs the dependencies and sets up reviewdog to execute our configuration on a pull request. The details are <a href="https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/tree/main/lint">visible in our repository</a> but here are the important bits.</p>

<p>The following files (truncated for brevity) configure the plugins for testing markdown and text — and their individual settings.</p>

<p>Here are some of our example settings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Markdown bullets denoted with an asterisk '*'.</li>
  <li>Single space between sentences.</li>
  <li>Straight quotes (note this down, it will be important later in the post).</li>
  <li>Readability set to 18 years.</li>
  <li>Checking for spelling mistakes.</li>
  <li>Checking for insensitive or inconsiderate language.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-execution">The execution</h2>

<p>Similar to our <a href="/posts/automated-accessibility-testing-leveraging-github-actions-and-pa11y-ci-with-axe">automated accessibility testing</a> post, we use <a href="https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/blob/main/.github/workflows/reviewdog.yml">GitHub actions</a> to run our set up on pull requests. The setup is also tuned to only check the changes for the text issues and not all files. This encourages authors to focus on the changes they are submitting.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/pull/373/files">pull request 373</a> and the below screenshot you can see that the sentence, "Whole websites can now be easily crawled for bugs" that the word <strong>'easily'</strong> has been flagged as may be insensitive and we should try to avoid it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/insensitive-text-warning.png" alt="Screenshot of the insensitive warning" /></p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/pull/374/files">pull request 374</a> and the below screenshots you can see that I took an earlier version of this post and ran it through the process and got some good feedback.</p>

<p>In this screenshot we see a warning about a hard to read sentence.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/hard-to-read-sentence-warning.png" alt="Screenshot of the hard to read sentence warning" /></p>

<p>In this screenshot we see that a typo was misattributed as an insensitive word.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/typo-lead-to-insensitive-warning.png" alt="Screenshot of the typo that lead to insensitive warning" /></p>

<h3 id="automating-changes">Automating changes</h3>

<p>Some of the recommendations that are provided could be automatically edited, like changing smart quotes to straight quotes (remember the note from earlier). We do this using the pre-commit tool and here is an example:</p>

<p>In this screenshot we see a warning about a smart quote:
<img src="/assets/img/smart-quote-warning.png" alt="Screenshot before" /></p>

<p>In this screenshot the change is made for us and committed to the pull request:
<img src="/assets/img/smark-quote-fix.png" alt="Screenshot after" /></p>

<p>You can see the details at this URL: <a href="https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/pull/342">pull request 342</a>.</p>

<h3 id="future-considerations">Future considerations</h3>

<p>We are interested in adding the <a href="https://github.com/retextjs/retext-simplify">retext-simplify plugin</a> to check phrases for simpler alternatives and maybe reduce the age for readability. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/retextjs/retext/blob/main/doc/plugins.md">available plugins in the retext documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Following this set-up can help you inject tools to help you test your content. But remember, automation can be devoid of context and can still contain our biases.</p>

<p>You should keep tweaking the tools and double-check your content to make sure it meets your values.</p>
