<p>Juggling competing priorities, tight deadlines, and endless iterations can
make it easy to deprioritize accessibility considerations. In our work, we've
seen how neglecting accessibility can lead to frustrating user experiences and
other consequences. That's why we decided to <a href="https://github.com/readme/guides/fix-accessibility-bugs">treat accessibility issues with
the same urgency as any other bug</a>.</p>

<p>Enter the <a href="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/guide/defect-priority">Accessibility Bug Classification
Matrix</a>, which
we created to help us quickly prioritize issues based on their impact. It
provides a clear framework for promptly identifying and addressing the most
critical accessibility barriers.</p>

<h3 id="features-of-our-bug-classification-matrix">Features of our bug classification matrix</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Adapted from industry best practices</li>
  <li>Covers a wide range of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) criteria</li>
  <li>Prioritizes issues based on user impact severity</li>
  <li>Provides clear action steps for each priority level</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>As our team grows and projects become more complex, we've realized the value
of having a centralized process and systemic approach to prioritizing
accessibility bugs as they are discovered.</p>

<p>Inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/issue_impact.md">impact classifications developed by accessibility experts at
Deque</a>, we adapted their framework to fit our
workflows and priorities. The result is a helpful tool that helps our teams
quickly assess and prioritize accessibility issues based on their true
severity and impact on users.</p>

<p><strong>This matrix isn't just for accessibility experts.</strong> We designed it to be a
resource for all team members, regardless of the accessibility knowledge. By
providing clear definitions and examples for each priority level, we're
empowering everyone on our team to make informed decisions about what needs to
happen when a bug is discovered.</p>

<p>It's important to note that this isn't meant to be a rigid, exhaustive list of
every possible accessibility issue. We recognize that the field of
accessibility is constantly changing, and new challenges emerge.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility-as-a-team-sport">Accessibility as a team sport</h3>

<p>We're fostering a culture of shared responsibility by making this resource
available to the whole team. Accessibility shouldn't be limited to a few
experts. Whether you're a project manager triaging a backlog of issues, a QA
team member doing release testing, or a designer who has noticed something odd
when reviewing how their work was implemented, our <a href="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/guide/defect-priority">Accessibility Bug
Classification Matrix</a> provides a common language and clear guidance.</p>

<h3 id="assessing-failure-levels-and-issue-priorities">Assessing failure levels and issue priorities</h3>

<p>We've divided the matrix into five levels, each with its own set of criteria
and corresponding remediation priority.</p>

<h3 id="level-1-page-level-interference-single-a-wcag-criteria">Level 1: Page-level interference (Single A WCAG criteria)</h3>

<p>Think of this as the <em>"drop everything and fix it now"</em> category. Issues at
this level are the most severe, as they fundamentally block users with
disabilities from accessing essential content or functionality.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/696/0*lQ7GlQN8eGmycoN2" alt="Table of criteria showing page-level interference: the highest level of user
impact which should be addressed immediately." /> <em>See the full table of
criteria in the <a href="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/guide/defect-priority">Accessibility Bug Classification
Matrix</a>.</em></p>

<p>When we encounter issues like these, our priority is to address them
immediately, even if it means bypassing a regular release cycle. The user
impact is simply too high to defer resolving the issue.</p>

<h3 id="level-2-primary-component-failure">Level 2: Primary component failure</h3>

<p>Next up are issues that significantly degrade the user experience for key
components or content. While not as severe as Level 1 issues, these still
present substantial barriers for users with disabilities.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/696/0*4xc76HeIcSsHNu2s" alt="Table of criteria showing primary component failure: a high level of user
impact which should be addressed in the next release." /> <em>See the full table of
criteria in the <a href="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/guide/defect-priority">Accessibility Bug Classification
Matrix</a>.</em></p>

<p>The goal is to address these level 2 issues in the next regular release cycle.
They're high priority but with a bit more flexibility (compared to Level 1).</p>

<h3 id="level-3-component-interference">Level 3: Component interference</h3>

<p>At this level, we're dealing with issues that, while not completely blocking
access, still present significant usability challenges for assistive
technology users.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/696/0*oVWReMPvFkHYWcva" alt="Table of criteria showing component interference: a medium level of user
impact which should be addressed within the quarter." /> <em>See the full table of
criteria in the <a href="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/guide/defect-priority">Accessibility Bug Classification
Matrix</a>.</em></p>

<p>Our target for Level 3 issues is to resolve them within the current quarter as
part of regular backlog refinement.</p>

<h3 id="level-4-page-or-component-degradation">Level 4: Page or component degradation</h3>

<p>These issues, while still important to address, have a lower impact on overall
usability. They may hinder compliance or present minor annoyances but
typically have workarounds.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/696/0*51OqVlaG9hi8AuPk" alt="Table of criteria showing page or component degradation: a low level of user
impact which should be addressed when doing related work." /> <em>See the full table of
criteria in the <a href="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/guide/defect-priority">Accessibility Bug Classification
Matrix</a>.</em></p>

<p>We prioritize these for remediation as we're doing related development work or
as time allows.</p>

<h3 id="level-5-missing-best-practices">Level 5: Missing best practices</h3>

<p>Finally, we have issues that might not be strictly related to compliance but
represent opportunities to enhance accessibility and user experience. For
these, we rely on ongoing accessibility education and awareness among our
teams to consistently apply best practices and bake these in from the start.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/696/0*t738ZM2l0h5zXje6" alt="Table of criteria showing missing best practices: the lowest level of user
impact which should be addressed as time allows." /> <em>See the full table of
criteria in the <a href="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/guide/defect-priority">Accessibility Bug Classification
Matrix</a>.</em></p>

<p>By breaking issues down into clear, actionable levels, we can ensure that the
most impactful issues are addressed promptly while still being pragmatic about
making improvements.</p>

<h3 id="advancing-accessibility-one-bug-at-a-time">Advancing accessibility, one bug at a time</h3>

<p>Project realities like tight deadlines and limited resources often force teams
to make tough choices about where to focus their efforts. By using tools like
the <a href="https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/guide/defect-priority">Accessibility Bug Classification
Matrix</a> and
developing a culture of responsibility, teams can make meaningful progress
without compromising other project goals. A clear, actionable framework lets
us be strategic about where to spend our time to provide the biggest impact.
The key is to approach accessibility pragmatically <em>and</em> as an ongoing
process.</p>
