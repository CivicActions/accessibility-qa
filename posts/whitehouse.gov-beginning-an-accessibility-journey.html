<p>With the inauguration on January 20, the WhiteHouse.gov team released a new
website. A noticeable and well received feature of the new site is that it
once again has an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/accessibility/">accessibility
statement</a> which is linked in the
footer of every page — a best practice that demonstrates this administration's
commitment to serving all Americans of all abilities.</p>

<p>The short-but-aspirational statement makes it clear that this is just the
beginning, and that the White House team will continue working to build a site
that is accessible and usable by folks who are challenged by impairments,
using assistive devices, or facing situational barriers that make it harder to
navigate online.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The statement serves as an initial step toward making the website, and all
services, accessible to the greatest number of people possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The statement serves as an initial step toward making the website, and all
services, accessible to the greatest number of people possible. It's clear
that this administration isn't just aiming for compliance with the current
requirements of the recently-refreshed <a href="https://www.section508.gov/blog/accessibility-news-the-
section-508-Update">Section 508
guidelines</a>, but going the full extent to align with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/">WCAG 2.1
AA</a> — the latest W3C
recommendation and the standard beginning to be adopted by governments
worldwide.</p>

<h3 id="an-even-better-statement-suggestions-for-improvement">An even better statement: suggestions for improvement</h3>

<p>While the newly released accessibility statement is a laudable first step,
it's understood to be a work-in-progress. Everyone working on digital products
and projects for public services should be continually looking for
opportunities to make them more accessible, and the White House statement
specifically invites comments on ways to improve. Our recommendations include:</p>

<h4 id="make-it-easy-to-get-in-touch">Make it easy to get in touch</h4>

<p>To make it easier for people to flag problems with the site or give feedback,
more ways to get in touch could be offered. There are currently several phone
numbers listed (including some for hearing impaired folks — well done!), but a
web form, email address, or even Twitter account could be added to allow users
to digitally submit ways to improve the site. After all, some people are non-
verbal, and others might feel a bit shy about picking up the phone and calling
the White House!</p>

<p>Additionally, digital feedback options can capture browser and operating
system information and allow people to upload screenshots, which makes
debugging easier. Email and Twitter can be used to gather information into a
common issue queue to manage feedback and make sure that issues are identified
and fixed in a timely manner.</p>

<h4 id="address-the-whole-white-house-experience">Address the whole White House experience</h4>

<p>The accessibility statement could be expanded to provide users with
information about the accessibility features of the White House itself, not
just the website. For example, when we are able to do White House tours again,
where will visitors go to find out if there is an accessible washroom? There
may also be mobile apps that fall under the White House management that need
to be covered in accessibility considerations. Thinking about all aspects of
services (digital and physical) can help agencies provide the most holistic
accessible experience to everyone.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h4 id="account-for-accessibility-limitations">Account for accessibility limitations</h4>

<p>Recognizing that accessibility is a journey that never ends, it's important to
acknowledge where there are limitations that impaired people may encounter
breakdowns in accessibility. For example, if users navigate to <strong>archived
pages</strong> of the website, they will likely find them less accessible than the
current pages that are being brought up to an improved standard.</p>

<p><strong>Legacy files and videos</strong> may also be found lacking in accessibility. If
there is published content that isn't accessible but is still being served up
to people, the statement can identify it, and explain if there is a process
for requesting that the material be provided in an accessible format.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recognizing that accessibility is a journey that never ends, it's important
to acknowledge where there are limitations that impaired people may
encounter breakdowns in accessibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And of course there is the challenge of the ever-beloved-by-government <strong>PDF
files</strong>. Will the WhiteHouse.gov team be continuing to use PDF files, or
<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/07/16/why-gov-uk-content-should-be-
published-in-html-and-not-pdf/">following the model that the UK has
recommended</a>? If PDFs will be used, is there a plan for
making them accessible, or providing the information in an additional format
that is accessible? Will large print versions be made available, or only on
request? These are all questions that can be addressed in a robust
accessibility statement.</p>

<h3 id="show-how-the-sausage-is-made">Show how the sausage is made</h3>

<p>Accessibility and transparency are closely linked. There is an opportunity
here to provide visibility into how WhiteHouse.gov is built, which can promote
better understanding and usability for everyone. The White House could explain
that the site is built with WordPress and that they are following the
<a href="https://wordpress.org/about/accessibility/">accessibility best practices</a>
defined in the WordPress community. This includes using a plug-in that allows
users to switch between high/low contrast, as well as change the font size.
Many people still don't know about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mobile-phones/what-is-dark-mode-and-
should-you-be-using-it/">dark
mode</a>, or how they can configure it by default in their
browser.</p>

<p>If the site is built on the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/">United States Web Design
System</a> (USWDS), it would be useful to
highlight this. This is a U.S. Government framework that has been extensively
tested for accessibility best practices. It may be worth noting that the White
House is committed to keeping up with the USWDS and will be applying updates
to this framework to keep up-to-date with security/accessibility best
practices. If there are deviations from the standard implementation, this
could be explained.</p>

<p>It would be also important to know what is the testing process used internally
in the WhiteHouse.gov team. Are automated tools used? Are new features tested
with people who have lived experience with disability? Does the team test for
keyboard-only users? Has anyone checked what happens to text if someone zooms
in their browser to enlarge 300%? Explaining the extent of testing that has
been done will allow people to predict what level of accessibility they may
find for their own particular needs when using WhiteHouse.gov.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility-statement-best-practices">Accessibility statement best practices</h3>

<p>For the White House team, and for all of us working to create digital services
that are usable by the greatest number of people, there are guidelines to
help. If any team is looking to start with a robust accessibility statement,
they may start with the advice of accessibility expert Denis Boudreau, who
summarized <a href="https://twitter.com/dboudreau/status/1191780846501584899">the four essential elements of an accessibility
statement</a>. It
should have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Statement of intention to best serve people with disabilities</li>
  <li>Reference to the standards followed (usually WCAG 2.0 AA)</li>
  <li>Examples of accessible implementations on their site</li>
  <li>How to reach out with comments or requests for help</li>
</ul>

<p>Accessibility expert <a href="https://blog.tenon.io/sample-post">Karl Groves outlined a
list</a> that adds: "What are you doing to
support and improve accessibility?" as an important element. Lainey Feingold,
a well respected legal accessibility expert, has suggested that an <a href="https://www.lflegal.com/2013/02/access-info-
pages/#Components-of-the-ideal-Accessibility-Statement">ideal
accessibility statement</a> would also include
references to an organization's accessibility policies and include information
about other accessibility services. Web accessibility firm Microassist
developed a <a href="https://www.microassist.com/digital-accessibility/the-value-of-
digital-accessibility-statements-a-checklist-for-getting-started/">useful checklist for getting
started</a>.</p>

<p>The W3C has an <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/generator">accessibility statement
generator</a> which
adds in section for technical information that might help a user better
navigate the site. <a href="https://disabilityin.org/resource/digital-
accessibility-statement-best-practices/">Disability:IN</a> and the UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-
statement">Government Digital
Service</a> have also produced some excellent guides. The accessibility
statement page, perhaps more than any other page, should be kept current so
people can access accurate information — and of course it should be made as
<em>accessible</em> as possible!</p>

<h3 id="a-website-for-all-people">A website for all people</h3>

<p>It is encouraging to see what the new administration has done to emphasize the
importance of accessibility, even in the first weeks after the inauguration.
There is a real commitment from the Biden team to meet the needs of all
people, clearly including the 20% that have disabilities. The web team behind
the White House site — like all of us who are working in support of government
digital services — have a significant challenge ahead, but an equally
significant obligation to do the hard work and always be improving. The
American people deserve no less.</p>
