<p><strong>Mike:</strong> For me, it started with <em>**</em> empathy and friendship. Alan Shain,
who's been a roommate and friend since 1990, has cerebral palsy. He's a former
bureaucrat and a comic who has been active in the Canadian arts community.</p>

<p>He's taught me the importance of the disability rights movement. Knowing him
got me thinking more about humanity and the abilities we possess, and the
notion that we are all only "temporarily able-bodied." We have some abilities
right now, but that may change drastically tomorrow. As we grow older, things
inevitably happen to our bodies. Yet, we have a big aversion to the idea of
our own mortality, so we often overlook that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"We are all only temporarily able-bodied — we have some abilities right
now, but that may change drastically tomorrow."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Through many conversations with Alan, I've become more appreciative of how
other people move through this world. There's much more to accessibility than
people realize. It helps to open our minds and consider that there are
temporary and situational disabilities, such as ones caused by medications, or
even by losing your glasses. You could have trouble doing your taxes because
you have to care for your children, or because you're simply struggling to
juggle more than one thing at a time. You could be trying to access a website
with low contrast while outside on a sunny day. These are all examples of
accessibility issues.</p>

<p><strong>When you think about web accessibility, what are some common misconceptions
or mistakes you see? How can they be addressed?</strong></p>

<p>A lot of people assume things are accessible, when in fact they are not. Take
Drupal's website, for example. People assume that Drupal.org is accessible,
and therefore, no other work needs to be done. While Drupal has some built-in
accessibility features, there are other issues that aren't coming to light.</p>

<p>I would love to have people adopt the mindset that accessibility features
should be included from the start, and not as an afterthought. Wanting to be
more accessible today than yesterday should always be the goal. This means
building frameworks that pave the way for inclusive, forward-thinking
practices. We're dealing with something that changes all the time, so it's
about more than just performance. We need to be constantly finding ways of
bringing more people into the conversation; we're excluding far too many
people.</p>

should be included from the start, and not as an afterthought."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What changes have you seen over time in this industry?</strong></p>

<p>The number of educational resources addressing accessibility issues has
increased significantly. And they are much more timely and interesting than a
decade ago, when the conversation first shifted towards these issues.</p>

<p>For example, tools like <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">axe accessibility
testing</a> provide more opportunities to uncover
problematic issues on websites. It would be great if we could monitor those
instances even more. In Europe the government is tasked with monitoring the
access of all public websites. The results have to be published, which holds
them accountable to the standards they set, and increases the transparency of
existing issues. If a department scores low on accessibility compliance,
people will know, and expect a response. It's like checkers! The good thing is
that there are standard automated tools that can trawl websites and show where
improvements can be made.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see web accessibility going in the future? Do you have any
"big bets" when it comes to emerging technologies or trends?</strong></p>

<p>I think <em>**</em> VR and augmented reality will have a big impact soon. We're at
the edge of them being more meaningfully included in our lives. It would be
great for engagement — an interactive way to start thinking about how to make
emerging technologies more accessible. Computers are built into so many
devices, but they still contain significant impairments. Washing machines and
other appliances could be adapted to be more intuitive, too.</p>

<p><strong>For people reading this, how can they be part of the solution?</strong></p>

<p>Ask questions and explore what's out there. Educate yourself, and spend time
trying to understand how other people interact with the web and how important
that access is to all of us. Look into features like the Wave toolbar and
accessibility insights from Microsoft to get a sense of accessibility issues
that others face. These tools are great for evaluating and aiding in awareness
of the existing problems, and are structured to give users a visual cue of
where they might be.</p>

<p>Also, try to make the conversation about accessibility personal. Ask people
about the needs their parents might have as they age. What general challenges
will they face? For example, when you're younger, it's easier for you to
memorize things. but that changes as we age. Show people how we face similar
challenges at different points in our lives, and normalize addressing those
concerns now rather than later. That said, there are one in five people
suffering from permanent disabilities, so the probability of you knowing
someone with one is very high.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Try to make the conversation about accessibility personal."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why should the government prioritize web accessibility in procurement?</strong></p>

<p>Government is the largest single purchaser of goods and services, so as an
entity, it has a huge impact on setting accessibility standards for everyone
else. If the government commits to only buying accessible tech, it will change
the world. Currently though, the federal government often favors certain
corporations, or software or tools that have barriers to accessibility.</p>

<p><strong>Do you see open source software as a way to improve accessibility at
scale?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, using open source tools can actually be <a href="https://medium.com/civicactions/4-ways-to-improve-government-
accessibility-through-open-source-8e20fabc7281">part of an accessibility
strategy</a> for a government organization.
For example, Drupal issues can affect a million websites that use it, but
because it is open source, fixing issues in the Drupal core fixes them
everywhere — the scalability is huge. With proprietary software, you'll have
to cobble together your best hope of an answer to any issues that arise. You
may not be able to share information outside of a silo because of bureaucratic
or intellectual property issues with the software you are being forced to use.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Open source tools can actually be part of an accessibility strategy for a
government organization."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's more efficient to work in open source because when we get it right, it
scales. The cost to the taxpayer for methods using proprietary software is
unsustainable; there's no way to share the wisdom. Everyone is struggling to
find the same solutions to problems, and they end up cobbling something
together instead of working effectively. Open source tech allows you to
explore all your options and get the best answer to a problem, because you
have a whole community supporting it. If you have questions about something,
and the community answers them for you, it's being answered for everyone else,
too.</p>
