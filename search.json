      "content"  : "Since launching the CivicActions Accessibility website, we&#39;ve had 9 contributors on GitHub and many more contributing to our guide, playbooks, and posts.We value openness, agility, inclusiveness and continuous improvement. Ensuring that our site is consistently built makes it easier to maintain in the long-run.As our website grows, we want to ensure our content mirrors our values — and that it scales with ease. So, we have enabled automated testing (and some updating) of text when it&#39;s submitted in a pull request.Content goals that match our valuesIt is important that this site demonstrates our values by being accessible and professional. That&#39;s why we eliminate unclear, insensitive language that could alienate our audience.Automation is not full-proof. It doesn&#39;t have context to understand why a sentence is structured a certain way or why particular words are used. It is a tool in our arsenal to help us continuously improve, like catching terms that might be offensive or simplifying complex sentences, and so on.The technologyMost content changes are done through plain text editors or directly on GitHub. So, many of the conveniences that are built into modern word processing applications aren&#39;t available. The following tools help us keep the quality of our site high.To achieve the testing we use the following technologies:  remark: A markdown processor (Markdown is how we write all our content that is then compiled into static HTML pages by Jekyll).  retext: A natural language processor to check for issues in the text.  reviewdog: Takes the errors and warnings from remark and retext and comments on the markdown text in the code (pull request) indicating the issues and recommended corrections.  pre-commit: Also test files for any issues and in some cases updates the text automatically.  docker and GitHub Actions: Used to run the reviewdog scripts with remark and retext whenever a pull request is submitted.The setupFor remark/retext we create a Docker image that installs the dependencies and sets up reviewdog to execute our configuration on a pull request. The details are visible in our repository but here are the important bits.The following files (truncated for brevity) configure the plugins for testing markdown and text — and their individual settings.Here are some of our example settings:  Markdown bullets denoted with an asterisk &#39;*&#39;.  Single space between sentences.  Straight quotes (note this down, it will be important later in the post).  Readability set to 18 years.  Checking for spelling mistakes.  Checking for insensitive or inconsiderate language.remarkrc.problem file:{  &quot;settings&quot;: {    &quot;listItemIndent&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,    &quot;bullet&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,    &quot;strong&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,    &quot;emphasis&quot;: &quot;_&quot;,    &quot;fences&quot;: true  },  &quot;plugins&quot;: [      &quot;remark-frontmatter&quot;,      &quot;remark-validate-links&quot;,      &quot;remark-comment-config&quot;,...

The setup is also tuned to only check the changes for the text issues and not all files. This encourages authors to focus on the changes they are submitting.ExamplesIn pull request 373 and the below screenshot you can see that the sentence, &quot;Whole websites can now be easily crawled for bugs&quot; that the word &#39;easily&#39; has been flagged as may be insensitive and we should try to avoid it.In pull request 374 and the below screenshots you can see that I took an earlier version of this post and ran it through the process and got some good feedback.In this screenshot we see a warning about a hard to read sentence.In this screenshot we see that a typo was misattributed as an insensitive word.Automating changesSome of the recommendations that are provided could be automatically edited, like changing smart quotes to straight quotes (remember the note from earlier). We do this using the pre-commit tool and here is an example:In this screenshot we see a warning about a smart quote:In this screenshot the change is made for us and committed to the pull request:You can see the details at this URL: pull request 342.Future considerationsWe are interested in adding the retext-simplify plugin to check phrases for simpler alternatives and maybe reduce the age for readability. Check out the available plugins in the retext documentation.ConclusionFollowing this set-up can help you inject tools to help you test your content. But remember, automation can be devoid of context and can still contain our biases.You should keep tweaking the tools and double-check your content to make sure it meets your values.Further reading and examples  The same tools above are used in:          Quality docs.

      "content"  : "Today is the Global Accessibility Awareness Day or GAAD, and people around the world organize events to raise awareness about digital accessibility. Especially as everything is online these days, GAAD has become something that celebrate throughout the month of May.2020 was the 10th anniversary, and also the launch of the GAAD Foundation.I represented Drupal in Funka&#39;s We4Authors Accessibility Cluster. Yesterday, Funka organized a pre-GAAD event to highlight the importance of authoring tools.Authoring tools with built-in accessibility! was a wonderful success with over hundred participants from over 35 countries around the world.The We4Authors Cluster is a multi-CMS (Content Management System) group that is working to better support authors. Authors need to be subject matter experts, not accessibility experts, and CMS tools can help make their job easier. It should be simple for everyone to produce accessible content. For folks familiar with the W3C&#39;s Web Accessibility Initiative, it is essentiallylooking at implementing Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 - Part B. By bringing together leaders in CMS solutions that are popular with governments in the European Union, we are finding solutions which can help many of the authors that will need to implement the European Union&#39;s Web Accessibility Directive.The challenge that governments face to see that their digital solutions are able to meet the needs of all citizens is significant. By working together and funding common solutions to widely used libraries the European Commission is able to make a very cost-effective contribution to improving accessibility. Millions of citizens in member states will benefit from having better accessibility defaults.Both proprietary &amp;amp; open source communities were involved in the We4Authors Cluster and both can help develop common best practices.It was also terrific to see the efforts that the organizers placed on accessibility for this event. A live captionist was engaged for the event. That text was automatically translated into multiple languages so that representatives in non-English speaking countries could participate.Building in accessibility best practices can really help so many people engage with digital content. Everyone can benefit, whether they have a disability or not.",

      "content"  : "We launched the CivicActions Accessibility practice area and its accompanying website in January 2021.Our intent is for the practice area to be an open project and community for CivicActions team members, and the broader digital government service industry, including clients, partners, government contractors, and generally anyone who wants to improve accessibility on the web.Practicing what we preachWe realized early on that if we were going to be truly inclusive with our work and provide accessibility resources to the broader community, we should strive to make the website as accessible as possible.While we acknowledge that automated testing isn&#39;t a panacea, it&#39;s one way to address accessibility issues quickly and at scale.Using GitHub and open source technology – general and accessibility-specific – we created a continuous accessibility integration environment that helps us better practice what we preach.Our technology and accessibility &quot;stack&quot;We proudly leverage open source technologies wherever possible, and all of these tools used here meet that criteria.The site is powered by Jekyll and U.S. Web Design System, specifically the U.S. Web Design System Jekyll theme maintained by 18F and the USWDS team. The site is hosted through GitHub Pages.We added automated accessibility testing using GitHub Actions and pa11y-ci with axe.Configuring Jekyll with a sitemap and npmWe recommend adding a sitemap.xml generator to Jekyll which will be used by pa11y-ci to test all pages. We use the jekyll-sitemap plugin.We recommend using npm to manage the pa11y-ci packages and commands. Run npm init command to create the package.json file.Installing pa11y-ci and setting it up to run locallyInstall pa11y-ci as a development dependency with npm.npm i --save-dev pa11y-ciAfter the installation is complete edit the package.json and add the following commands to the &quot;scripts&quot; section:&quot;start-detached&quot;: &quot;bundle exec jekyll serve --detach&quot;,&quot;pa11y-ci:sitemap&quot;: &quot;pa11y-ci --sitemap http://localhost:4000/sitemap.xml --sitemap-exclude &quot;/*.pdf&quot;&quot;  start-detached: Starts the webserver that will run Jekyll to be used for testing.  pa11y-ci:sitemap: Runs pa11y-ci tests using the sitemap and excludes PDFs.Add a JSON file named .pa11yci which allows you to configure pa11y-ci with various options.

Here is an open issue to find a solution to that: https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci/issues/128.Running pa11y-ci in a GitHub actionNow that we have it running locally, here is how we configure it to run every time we submit a pull request in GitHub.Add a YML file to .github/workflows folder.

Please review the comment in the pull request or the pa11y-ci step in the workflow for details.&quot;          exit 1From the top, this action is run only on pull requests and uses the ubuntu-latest image. Then the steps will:  Check out the source code.  Install the Jekyll Ruby dependencies but caches them so that subsequent runs can go faster.  Install the pa11y-ci dependencies via npm.  Start the webserver as we did locally.  Run pa11y-ci to test the site and capture the output to a file.*  Read the file to a variable so that we can use it in the next step.*  Send the results of the file to the pull request as a comment in a &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; collapsed element.*  Check the output for failures and &quot;hard fail&quot; the action.** Capturing the output to a file and commenting on the pull request are optional features and could be harder to maintain. You can simply run the pa11y-ci commands and view the results in the action output.Here is an example screenshot of the GitHub action run of pa11y-ci tests (taken from https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/pull/127/checks):Here is an example screenshot of the comments added to a pull request (taken from https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/pull/137#issuecomment-796975773):SummaryUsing the above steps, you can quickly get your GitHub-hosted Jekyll site automatically tested for accessibility issues, but remember, automatic tests are not a panacea.As noted in our playbook for automated testing:  … no matter the tool, automated testing only catches about one-third of accessibility issues, so it cannot be relied upon to determine if a site complies. To better ensure that their digital tools are accessible to keyboard-only and assistive technology users, automated tests need to be done along with a robust manual testing plan.Further reading and examples  Automated accessibility testing with Travis CI  How to Automate Web Accessibility Testing  Examples of applying the above steps to Jekyll sites:          BBC&#39;s &quot;Accessibility, News and You&quot; can be seen in this pull request: https://github.com/dmundra/accessibility-news-and-you/pull/1.

By leveraging open source best practices, we can benefit from much larger teams which have done extensive testing of their patterns.## ColorThe website color palette is based on the [USWDS color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/system-tokens/).## TechnologyThe pages on this website are primarily written in Markdown which substantially reduces the range of errors available in HTML. These are then compiled using Jekyll and presented to the user as structured HTML5. The site is hosted on GitHub, which has a very broad community of users who are free to to add issues or pull requests. We use [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) with [Pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y) to evaluate that every page follows basic accessibility best practices.

We use a [project board](https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/projects) to iteratively make progress on our goals, collaborate on issues, have open discussions, deliver a [working site](https://accessibility-qa.civicactions.com/) and respond to the changes that happen constantly in the world of accessibility.## Accessibility and AgileWe encourage accessibility in every part of agile processes. Examples, adding inclusive user archetypes to design sprints, adding accessibility tests to the definition of done, demonstrating how a product is accessible in sprint reviews, prioritizing accessibility goals in retrospectives, delivering accessible product increments, and much more.### Examples of places to encourage adoption of accessibility* Understanding accessibility needs in discovery.  * Developing personas/archetypes that represent accessibility questions in design sprints.* Adding accessibility requirements to working agreement/definition of done.* Adding accessibility acceptance criteria to user stories.  * Creating specific user stories for permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities.* Using accessibility testing tools:  * Developing a feature locally.  * Automated testing when pushing code to a branch or infrastructure.  * Testing a feature in QA or production.* User accessibility testing after a feature/project delivery.* Doing manual testing.* Reviewing site-wide automated tests.* Reviewing with assistive technology (VoiceOver/NVDA).## Examples of our practices* [Accessibility Personas](https://github.com/mgifford/Personas)* [Automated testing](/playbook/automated-testing#civicactions-approach)"

We&#39;ve outlined our approach and learn about the broad range of services we offer at [CivicActions our central website](https://civicactions.com/approach). CivicActions has deep experience with open source software and agile development - both lend themselves to great accessibility practices. Our goals are audatious, but we have a talented team and aren&#39;t working in isolation. Because we are actively invovled in open communities, we are able to draw on and contribute to a vibrant, evolving ecosystem. This is necessary, if we are going to ensure that we are able to support our clients in building digital content that is more accessible today than it was yesterday. ## Basic servicesWe do offer training, technical reviews and monitoring services. We have considerable experience with remediating sites built on open source technology like Drupal. Collectively our team has over 500 years of experience with the Drupal community. Our team has played a key role in seeing that this Content Management System (CMS) is a leader in accessibility. We&#39;re involved in many other open source projects, and have have extensive experience leveraging open source communities to help our clients accomplish their needs. For any organization seeking to implement consistent, secure, user friendly and accessible experiences, open source provides unparralled flexibility. Very few organizations have our level of experience in maximizing usage of open source approaches to problem solving. We can help your software development teams bring accessibility into every sprint so that accessibility solutions are cheaper and more robust. By building accessibility into our process we can ensure that there aren&#39;t compliance surprises at the end of the project. ## Holistic approachesWe like to begin all of our accessibility work with an extensive discovery process that allows us to get a high-level perspective of the organization&#39;s accessibility maturity. This systems approach to accessibility includes user research and policy/practice evaluation so we can help your team identify the barriers in your site today, as well as to avoid the ones that otherwise would be introduced tomorrow. Borrowing from the best practices of Service Design, we know that giving people the right incentives and examples, is as important as having good tools and templates. Our team has a unique methodology to bring our deep technical understanding to build organization-wide strategies to embrace accessibility. The technical challenges of accessibility will only be addressed when we have accessibility confident organizations.

        "content"  : "It is good to do some testing with assistive technology (AT), but it takes considerable experience for a sighted user to use a screen reader like a blind user would. Because of the nature of vision related disabilities there is considerable variation even within the blind and low vision community.Job Access With Speech (JAWS) is a common screen reader tool that enables people with visual impairments to read digital content, either by text-to-speech or Braille display. However, JAWS is not free. Use of Microsoft&#39;s Narrator is increasing, but still trails behind other screen readers. Few governments are using NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA), even though it is a free, open source solution that is nearly as popular with the blind community. All Apple products come with VoiceOver which is another powerful screen reader. Android comes with the open source TalkBack screen reader.There are a range of other assistive technologies which are available to support other disabilities. We often overlook voice control, with tools like Dragon Naturally Speaking, Windows Speech and Apple&#39;s Voice Control. There is a range of disabilities where motion for the user is severely limited and where simple switches need to be employed to navigate the website. Probably the most famous switch user was Stephen Hawking used a handheld switch early in his life, but then moved to a cheek switch when he lost control of his hands.Whatever software you choose, it is always good practice to support the latest two major releases of assistive technology to allow for late adopters, and to test with actual blind users. It takes considerable effort for a sighted user to learn to use a screen reader how a blind user does., and simply being able to use one of these assistive technology tools may not be the best way to evaluate if a page is accessible.Checklist  Ensure your team has access to a desktop screen reader in Windows and Apple as well as a mobile one.  Test navigating the website with voice control (speech to text).  Ensure that you have access to the latest version of the assistive technology.Key questions  Does your team have the deep knowledge that is required to understand how a blind user actually understands the page?  Is user testing done with people who are completely blind, partially sighted, and who become blind as adults? Screen reader users have a lot of flexibility."

It has provided very useful as a means to include people with hearing loss in Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and now Zoom meetings, as well. There are many applications which are proving useful for people who are blind, low vision or those who are color blind. There are ways that it could be used to support people with all forms of disability.On the other hand, there are a lot of AI projects which are making bold claims which exaggerate what they can actually do, and where it is possible to actually hurt people with disabilities. A popular example is the AccessiBe widget that boldly claims to use AI to make your website WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, while failing to do so. AI Image recognition for alt text is another example, where people are hoping to simply replace the human effort of writing a meaningful alt text.Jutta Treviranus has pioneered many important inclusion initiatives, and her work on AI is no exception. The edge cases are always going to be at a higher risk of being misunderstood while using machine learning. We need to shift our design approaches from merely satisfying 80% of the users, to build for the fringe. As with other minorities groups, people with disabilities are often disadvantaged with biased data.We can use machine learning to support accessibility, but in many cases it is better to approach it from the approach of Intelligence Augmented (IA). How do we use AI to support authors to produce better content. Perhaps it is by suggesting alt text for the author to review and modify (if needed). AI can also look for patterns in larger datasets than people can process to look for errors that a human would find difficult to pick out.Key questions  What algorithms are you using in your organization?  Have those been assessed for bias?"

        "content"  : "Many of the accessibility errors on the web are accidentally produced by unsuspecting content editors. With the right processes and tools in place, we can make it easier to produce accessible content—and harder to publish inaccessible content.To start to address this issue, the EU recently commissioned Funka—a Swedish accessibility firm—to conduct a pilot called We4Authors on web authoring tools, producers and communities. The pilot evaluated several different Content Management Systems (CMS), including Drupal, to find ways to increase accessible publishing practices. What became clear, is that CMSs are currently contributing more to the problem than most are aware, by overlooking providing authors with support they need to produce accessible content. Many errors are a result of author inputs in the WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE, CKEditor, etc), and most web authors are not accessibility experts and so do not know the best practices to publish accessible content in their CMS. Most authors are not accessibility experts, and few have the time to go through the additional steps necessary to create accessible content.We4Authors demonstrates that many content producers and suppliers claim to deliver accessible content, many just don&#39;t understand accessibility. To make matters worse, CMSs are often not built from the author&#39;s perspective, which makes it hard to create accessible content and forces authors to navigate unintuitive publishing interfaces. Having a pleasant authoring experience isn&#39;t just a perk—it can greatly facilitate the production of accessible content—but unfortunately it&#39;s usually overlooked.The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0—a W3C Recommendation in 2015—is the most comprehensive approach to address the accessibility of authoring tools. Part A of the guidelines addresses the authoring interface to ensure that it too meets WCAG requirements, and Part B aligns directly with the goal of supporting authors in producing accessible content.Drupal 8 has worked to achieve many elements of both parts for ATAG 2.0 AA. More than any other popular CMS, Drupal&#39;s authoring environment is well-positioned to support authors with disabilities. Drupal has also implemented many measures to update the authoring experience and ensure more inclusive patterns are available to authors by default.ATAG 2.0 Part B identifies where a CMS can help authors create more accessible content. This doesn&#39;t remove the need for training, but should make it easier for people to implement best practices consistently. Government employees can&#39;t all be expected to be accessibility experts, but we can and must provide them with the right tools for creating accessible content.Checklist  Work to see that the authoring interface is accessible.  Feature ATAG 2.0 requirements as part of new technology procurement.  Simplify the authoring interface to make it easier for authors to make accessible content.  Include links to accessibility guidelines in help text where appropriate.Key questions  Are alt texts required? Can this be over-ridden for decorative images?  Are heading tags used semantically to describe the structure of the content?  Are authors given help on how to create accessible content (ie. how to write good alt text)?"

Developers can run automated checks as part of their continuous integration (CI) process  Everyone can look at the accessibility of a single page  Editors can be given accessibility issues within a WYSIWYG editor  Whole websites can now be easily crawled for bugs  Designers can evaluate problems with contrast issues in their designsAll of this is now possible with a range of proprietary and open source tools. With the rapid development of automated testing, there are now multiple options to gather information on a single website—or an entire government.Deque&#39;s aXe has changed the playing field for site reviews. Because of its flexible design, it can be executed from the command line, from within the browser, or even from a WYSIWYG editor. Being executed from the command line means that it is much easier to simply add accessibility checking to any scripts that are being run. It can be appended to a script crawling to ensure security best practices are maintained, or simply added to a continuous integration script.Axe also provides highly structured and easily actionable error reports. These empower entities to pinpoint and categorize issues—from alt text to problems with the symantec structure and missing language. Axe is also already incorporating elements of WCAG 2.1.The Axe accessibility engine is now built into Google&#39;s Lighthouse, Microsoft&#39;s Accessibility Insights, and a host of other projects. Axe can also be applied to the web, Android and Windows testing. This provides a huge amount of flexibility for most software development teams.Government Digital Services in both the United Kingdom and Singapore have leveraged Deque&#39;s open-source axe-core accessibility engine to create tools that crawl and gather accessibility barriers for both public-facing websites and internal web-based communications. Similar open-source accessibility engines have been built by IBM &amp;amp; Deque, and there are proprietary tools available from firms like WebAim, Tenon &amp;amp; Siteimprove.However, it is important to note that, no matter the tool, automated testing only catches about one third of accessibility issues, so it cannot be relied upon to determine if a site complies. To better ensure that their digital tools are accessible to keyboard-only and assistive technology users, automated tests need to be done along with a robust manual testing plan.List of popular automated testing tools  Wave  Tenon  SiteImprove  See more tools in our guideCivicActions ApproachCurrently CivicActions uses the following approaches.Pa11y-ciPa11y-ci is a continuous integration (CI) runner that can test a few pages or an entire site for accessibility issues. Our projects include pa11y-ci in their CI pipelines and generate reports as artifacts or comments with the results of the testing.We are currently testing this accessibility site using pa11y-ci.Cypress testing with the axe coreCypress is a JavaScript testing framework that is used for automated testing. Axe core is a popular accessibility testing engine. Our projects use cypress with the axe core to test components for accessibility issues.Take a look at Setting up Cypress with axe for accessibility article that illustrates the setup.Checklist  Continuous Integration tests incorporate accessibility tools like axe and errors block commits.  Patterns and pages are regularly reviewed to see that they test patterns available to authors.  Site-wide scans are used to track errors over time and catch both common and weird issues.  Creators of digital content all have some browser extension that allows them to quickly evaluate page-level accessibility.Key questions  Are you using a variety of automated testing tools to help identify potential problems?

Ultimately though, it is useful to change the review process on a regular basis to ensure that people continue to learn new ways to create better content.Tools like Accessibility Insights have an assessment component that guides users through a fine tooth manual review of a webpage. Using this tool, organizations could:  Run the FastPass&#39;s automated axe checks on every page.  Check that the Tab stops follow a logical order when navigating with a keyboard.  Look over the elements that are marked Needs reviews to see if there are elements where a manual review can identify whether it is an issue or not.  Complete the rest of the assessment to ensure that the page meets WCAG requirements.This is a time consuming process, but would give the reviewer a high level of confidence that the site has good accessibility.One could also look to use a tool like WebAim&#39;s WAVE, ANDI, or Tota11y to scan a web page for errors. In which case a reviewer could do something like this:  Scan the page with the WAVE Toolbar:          Look for clear errors (red boxes with an X in them).      See if the alt text effectively describes the images on the page.      Ensure that there is sufficient color contrast.        Do keyboard only testing (using just tab, shift-tab, arrow keys &amp;amp; escape) to navigate the page.  Evaluate page for plain language using free tools like the HemingwayApp.  Magnify the page up to 200% and look for usability and readability issues.There are lots of checklists, rotating through a few of them will help give different people different things to think about accessibility:  W3C&#39;s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)  18F - USA Government  UK&#39;s Government Digital Services (GDS)  Government of Canada  WebAim  Elsevier&#39;s WCAG 2.1 Checklist  A11yProject  Heydon Works  VoxMedia  PSU  Yale  Washington UniversityChecklist  Have a checklist that builds on automated testing approaches.

Working virtually allows some people with disabilities to excel. Often people with physical disabilities face barriers in traditional office environments which may not be able to provide an accessible office or sufficient accommodations to participate equally. By using video conferencing, slack, email and other online collaboration tools, our team is able to use a more customized workspace at home, and skip the need to commute to a central office.Unfortunately, there are also people with disabilities which are excluded from participating in many distributed teams. Many deaf and hard of hearing people find it more difficult to read lips or intentions through video conferencing tools. Blind users are blocked by the many visual organization tools like Trello &amp;amp; Mural that do not have good support for blind users. Many websites do not have sufficient support for even keyboard only users.Fortunately, there are things that we can do to change this. Most popular video conferencing tools now offer AI driven speech to text captioning. This isn&#39;t perfect, but is continuing to improve. There is more pressure for visual kanban &amp;amp; sticky note tools to build in greater accessibility. More people are thinking about accessibility before buying IT for their office.Another approach that some organizations are doing is helping to assign a minder to help people with disabilities navigate systems that are not fully accessible.

This can be accomplished by assuring user research in discovery stages includes PwD. Usability testing of specific site features should also include PwD to ensure that the solution works as expected.Out of respect for their time, PwD shouldn&#39;t be engaged to test the accessibility of a website until the results of automated and basic manual tests are implemented.PwD&#39;s lived experience is critical for catching issues and errors that the tests miss, but it is important to not waste people&#39;s time replicating known problems that a computer or a non-disabled person can easily identify. See the playbooks on automated testing and manual testing for more information.When recruiting a testing cohort, it is important to consider the range of disabilities that need to be addressed. Should you test with people who were blind from birth and who use Braille, or those who became blind and use an audio interface? A legally blind person may have some sight, and may use a screen reader in combination with a screen magnifier. If there are audio components, it may be important to include members of the deaf community. People have a range of experiences of perceiving colour, and this can change over time. These are just a few examples.There are many different disabilities and people experiencing combinations of them. Depending on the size of the project you may want to adjust the number of participants who are involved. Most projects simply do not include enough people with disabilities. Remember too that there is variation in how people use Assistive Technology, and so one perspective may not reflect the needs of the whole community. A minimum size would include people with limitations in sight, hearing, mobility and cognition.Many disabilities are invisible, and because of the stigma that can be associated with disability, people may not feel comfortable disclosing this information to their peers. It is statistically likely that a team already includes people with disabilities, but often this is hidden and unknown to the rest of the group.Robust products and services are co-designed with the users. People with disabilities have expertise through lived experience that needs to be recognized, especially when building tools and services for them. &quot;Nothing About Us Without Us!&quot; is a common call in the disability movement, because all too often, people with disabilities are not engaged. Inclusive design is a process which is open and transparent and actively engages a wide diversity of abilities.Checklist  Include people with disabilities early in the process and before a product/service is launched  Build in the costs of accessibility testing into the project budgetKey questions  Are you building to the Pareto Principle, or the fringe?  How are you including a range of disabilities into your consultation process?Related  Do Manual Testing  Test with Assistive Technology"

This is usually associated with videos, to display real time textual equivalent of speech. Sometimes this moves beyond speech to include other sounds relevant to the video.Content (vs. presentation)The separation of concerns design principle as applied to the authoring and presentation of content. The two should be independent to see that the two are distinct and can be managed independently.Content management system (CMS)CMS is a software application used to oversee the operation of web information.

This act has implications for federal assistance and accommodation in the workplace. If an organization receives federal support of any kind, even if the organization is not a federal or state organization, the organization must comply with Section 504.Section 508Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Until the Section 508 Refresh, this requirement was based on best practices of 1998.Section 508 RefreshThe Refresh brought the guidelines for the USA to be essentially the same as WCAG 2.0 AA.Semantic markupSemantic Markup is the idea of creating more meaning with the information in web pages and web applications.

        "content"  : "A brief history of digital accessibility.Digital accessibility basicsDigital accessibility is both complicated and simple. It is complicated because there are many layers of technology involved in communicating content from an author to the user. It is simple because, ultimately, if you keep your site simple and follow some basic guidelines, you&#39;re generally going to achieve digital accessibility.Section 508The United States first led the movement to articulate web accessibility with the creation of Section 508 in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In 1998, the U.S. legislature corrected the shortcomings of the original Section 508 Amendment. This included a list of technical standards against which products can be evaluated to determine if they meet the technical compliance.WCAG and POURIn 1999 the World Wide Web Consortium&#39;s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 were published. The guidelines were built to be technology-agnostic—HTML was just one way to structure content on the web—and to accommodate the rapid pace of change online.For example, when the first iPhone was released in 2007, people had no idea how much mobile devices would revolutionize how people interact—both with digital content and each other. The web has continued to evolve rapidly. It is clear that nobody wants to create an app or a website that makes someone physically ill, but how much animation is acceptable? Where is the line between visual changes that help people identify where new content is, and the changes that cause some people to become sick?Additionally, since the WCAG process requires a great deal of negotiation—the standards must be based on evidence-based rules that have broad applicability—it isn&#39;t feasible to make specific guidelines for every disability. There are even occasions where designing a site for one type of disability (say, low vision users) will conflict with another disability (say, people with dyslexia).Rather than guidelines based on specific accommodations for particular disabilities, the W3C&#39;s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) settled on four key principles—known by the acronym POUR—which have guided digital accessibility. To be accessible, digital content must be:  Perceivable: users must be able to perceive the information being presented  Operable: users must be able to operate the interface  Understandable: users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface  Robust: users must be able to access the content as technologies advanceAs the web continues to change and develop, the guidelines to maintain accessibility need to as well. WCAG 2.0 was released in 2008, 2.1 was released in 2018, and 2.2 is slated for release in mid-2021. There may be other releases within the WCAG 2.x series, and the WAI has released the first draft of WCAG 3.0, which is working to revise the whole framework.In the near future, digital tools will be expected to be personalized so that every individual can maximize their use. And while digital accessibility continues to develop, it is clear that government bodies must invest to make their technology more accessible today than before.To be clear, no website will be 100% accessible. Any work that is done should strive for excellence, not perfection. Even a site that met WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance would not necessarily be accessible to everyone. Like security, accessibility is a journey where improvements must be constantly adapted to meet changing realities. Organizations must seek to be better today than they were yesterday.WCAG guidelines should be seen not as the goal to strive for, but a floor from which to build.Other governments around the world began implementing accessibility regulations. In Canada there was the Accessible Canada Act (ACA) and also several provincial acts like Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). Accessibility legislation occurs at all levels of government, and although there may be differences, web standards usually follow the WCAG recommendations.Harmonised European Standard &amp;amp; European Accessibility Act {#harmonised-european-standard-&amp;amp;-european-accessibility-act}Europe is currently seen as the leader in digital accessibility best practices. The Harmonised European Standard (EN 301 549) is a living document first published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in 2014. The latest version, 3.1.1, was published in November 2019 and embraces WCAG 2.1 AA as the minimum accessibility standard for countries in the EU. Governments in the EU are given the freedom to choose how they want to implement the standard within their own countries, and after the W3C releases WCAG 2.2, it will be reviewed for consideration for an upcoming release of EN 301 549.Web content makes up a lot of the material covered in the standard, but it also includes:  computers, smartphones, tablets and TV sets;  banking ATM and services, and payment terminals;  e-books and e-readers;  mobile apps and ticketing machines.Aligning with EN 301 549 means that government accessibility efforts evolve with an ever-changing internet. Since its creation, EN 301 549 has been embraced by the UK, Mexico and Australia, and will continue to be adopted around the world. There will be costs to adopting the standard, but doing so will make it easier for companies to trade on a global stage.In 2016, the European Union (EU) Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed the EU Web Accessibility Directive. The directive aims to ensure that all Europeans can take a full and active part in the digital economy and society. EU Member states had until 2018 to adapt the Directive into national law.In 2019, the EU formally adopted the European Accessibility Act (EAA) to create a common set of accessibility guidelines for member states. When it comes into effect in 2025, the EAA will apply to businesses as well as governments across the EU—any product or service that is sold for use within the Eurozone will need to comply, including the full range of digital tools. This will include any foreign businesses that work with EU member states.The goal of the EAA is to provide unrestricted access to people experiencing any form of disability and ensure that all EU citizens can access information and services through websites, mobile applications, and electronic devices.European monitoring requirementsBy December 23, 2021, all EU member states will be required to monitor the accessibility of their public-facing websites and report on progress over time. It will be up to member states to determine how this is done, but some of them will certainly leverage open source tools to aggregate national results.In the UK, the Government Digital Services (GDS) is playing the role of the central monitoring team to assess public websites and apps. This monitoring is designed to encourage the public sector to make timely improvements to accessibility. The hope is that with active engagement with various departments, the government can avoid the need to implement further enforcement. The GDS team isn&#39;t sampling all government sites, but is prioritizing those which threaten to exclude the most people, or where there are known or suspected problems. Like others in Europe, the UK has implemented Accessibility Statements into its standard web pages so that citizens are encouraged to submit feedback when they run into barriers. This feedback loop empowers the public and highlights barriers that have been missed by automated and manual testing.In the UK, by the time a website reaches a public beta it must have monitoring in place to identify potential problems. While the monitoring instructions don&#39;t specifically state accessibility, the GDS is actively building tools to make it easier to incorporate, including a site crawler that runs on an open-source accessibility engine built by Deque Systems, called Axe."

        "content"  : "OverviewYou worked hard getting your content online. How do you make sure your readers can find, understand  and use it? Apply plain language. Clear and direct writing makes your content accessible (it&#39;s also the law!). Plain language also helps people with different cognitive abilities. Or speakers of a non-English language. Or those who rely on audio to listen to text. You might also be writing for the public. Or a group of experts. Either way, your audience&#39;s reading level is likely lower than you think.Who this is for  CivicActions employees  Public servants  Government communications teams  Anyone designing content for the publicA quick guide to plain languageKeep it simpleAvoid:  Jargon and government legalese. If  you have to use an acronym, spell it out first.  Filler words. For example, use the word &#39;analyze&#39; not &#39;conduct an analysis&#39;.  Repetitive words  Irony or idioms  Intro text. For example, &quot;Welcome to our department homepage.&quot;Try:  Using active voice throughout your site  Writing one idea per sentence  Using the simpler synonym. For example, use not  utilize.  Keeping the reading level between 6th and 8th grade reading level. Remember to remove proper nouns and titles.Write for your audienceBefore writing, asking yourself: What are your reader&#39;s needs? What do they need to know or do after reading your content?Make it actionablePeople visit your website to do something: answer a question or complete a specific task.   Ask yourself: what are the top questions my target reader wants to know? How can I answer it quickly?Choose words your reader usesImagine you&#39;re talking to your reader over the phone. What words would you use to answer questions directly? You can also use different keyword research tools. Try Google&#39;s Keyword Research Planner or Moz Analytics. They can help you brainstorm user-friendly words and phrases related to your topic.Make it scannableStructure your content with clear headers. Present headers in a logical order. This will help a user scan the content easily to figure out what it&#39;s about. Make it specific to the topic or sub-topic. The clearest headers tell you something useful. Use bulleted lists to make content easy to scan. Remember: website users don&#39;t read, they scan. They often leave web pages within 10 to 20 seconds.Test your content with a readability toolAlways run your content through a readability tool. You can use  Hemingway App, Readable.io, or turn on Flesch-Kincaid if editing in Microsoft Word.  Try to get the reading grade level lower than 8th grade. Before using the tool, remember to remove:  proper nouns  titles  any domain-specific language you have to use. For example, a medical term you might need to include in your content.Do more &quot;just enough&quot; user testing with your audienceSee &quot;just enough&quot; article.Automated readability tools won&#39;t catch everything. You&#39;ll need to test your content with humans too. You can test:  Menu labels and micro-content. Keep your user goals in mind.  Language. Ask your users to read your content out loud. What words do they stumble over? How do they rate the clarity of the language (on a scale from 1 to 5)?  Understanding. Ask your users to paraphrase what they read.  What did they summarize correctly? What did they miss? What did they get wrong?Join a plain language community  Digital.gov Plain Language Action and Information Network.
