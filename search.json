      "content"  : "We spoke to CivicActioner Daniel Mundra, Associate Director of Drupal, aboutthe benefits of Drupal, community contributions, and why working atCivicActions has been so rewarding for him . He is among a team of 60+ Drupalengineers with nearly 20 Acquia certifications and 20+ edX a11y(Accessibility) certifications.CivicActions is known for our Drupal expertise. To you, why is Drupal suchan important tool in the work that we do for our government clients?Drupal is a complex tool but it is the best tool to help deliver complexconcepts for our government clients. Drupal also delivers for our clientswhile still being free, open source, having a growing community, and also notafraid to change/adapt. I don&#39;t believe other similar products could check allthose boxes.I have been working with Drupal for 12+ years, first with Drupal version 6 andnow with 10. Since my early days, Drupal has been a veritable Swiss army knifefor web development. It helped me deliver a lot of value to users in a quickamount of time. Earlier I would produce many sites with a lot of modules butnot consider the maintenance costs, reliability you get with writing tests,giving back to the community, and so on. It left my clients with a functionalsite but a maintenance burden. Nowadays I focus more on contributing back,writing more tests, reducing maintenance burden and thinking of long termsolutions than quicker output of sites. Just like how the Drupal platform andcommunity has evolved, so have I. Drupal has given me the space to do that andI am grateful for that.What are some community contributions to Drupal from your team that you areespecially proud of?CivicActions contributes quite a bit to Drupal. Last year CivicActions wascredited with contributing 90+ contributions and that is only growing. I amparticularly proud of the modules we are adding to the community, like MediaLink Enhancements (from Cameron Prince), Google Programmable Search JSON API(from Timo Zura and Sam Lerner), and recently Content Model Documentation (from Steve Wirt).You are very passionate about accessibility — why is accessibility soimportant to you and how do you work to make projects more accessible atCivicActions?Accessibility is important to me because to truly be human centered we have tomake technology accessible to all. The primary ways I work to make projectsmore accessible is by first building from the beginning with accessibility inmind. The second way is to add layers of accessibility testing to ensure thesite remains accessible. Layers like automated testing, manual testing withkeyboards/screen readers, and testing with disabled users (when possible).Accessibility is a long term commitment and I can say that at CivicActions weare all contributing to that and we are making a difference.What initially drew you to a career in civic tech, particularly atCivicActions?After spending 10 years working in higher education, in particular as an in-house developer for the University of Oregon, I wanted a change. As theuniversity was going away from in-house development, I wanted to continuegrowing my skills while still supporting similar mission-driven organizations.I found both at CivicActions.What is the most rewarding part of your job?Being able to give back to the community and also take part in the companyoutside of the project. I am an associate director now but I wouldn&#39;t havebeen able to reach that role without the support of everyone at CivicActions.They made space for me to take part in company activities like OKRs, guidebookupdates, accessibility practice area, and so on. I am successful because ofthe culture of the team to make space and make most parts of the companyaccessible to discussion, debate and continuous improvement.Any advice for someone looking to follow a similar career trajectory?Ask questions and get involved where you can, either at the company you workfor or in your local community. Find that company and community that energizesyou and bring your whole self to them.On a lighter note, what is a fun fact that people may not know about you?I like statistics so much that for 3 years I was the official statistician forthe Oregon Cricket League. Lots of data entry and review but I was able to seehow local players and teams evolved.Daniel Mundra: Diving into Drupal was originally published inCivicActions on Medium, where people arecontinuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "url"      : "/posts/helping-disabled-veterans-check-in-designing-an-accessibility-map",
      "content"  : "A note on language: We&#39;re using both people-first language (&quot;a person with adisability&quot;) and identity-first language (&quot;disabled person&quot;). We recognizeboth are valid and advocated for within the disability community.&quot;We lost our vision due to our service…my vision gets blurry,&quot; says a Veteranover Zoom during a user research session.We were testing new designs for a web-based app helping Veterans check into amedical appointment.This Veteran&#39;s experience is not uncommon: about 30% of Veterans live with adisability (but that number is likely much higher due to military culture).Almost 7,000 Veterans become newly blind or visually impaired every year. Anddisabilities can vary in type and severity — the most common of which includehearing loss, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), scars, back and neckpain, and migraines. Figure 1: A fewdays before an appointment, a Veteran receives an SMS text with a link tostart pre-check-in. After selecting the link, the Veteran sees the login page(first image). When they complete pre-check-in, they see the submission page(second image). Figure 2: When theVeteran arrives on the day of their appointment, a poster with instructions tocheck-in is placed in the facility. The Veteran scans the QR code or texts&#39;5309&#39; to check into their appointment using their phone. The Medical SupportAssistant (MSA) receives a notification that the Veteran has checked-in totheir appointment. The Veteran waits until called in.Checking into a medical appointment with a smartphone has barriersFor example, it requires a Veteran to:  Own a phone (or have access to one)  See the check-in poster at the facility  Have reasonable tech-savviness to use SMS or a QR code  Understand the steps within a reasonably short time-frame (which can be difficult for some Veterans with cognitive disability or PTSD)  We wanted to design digital and non-digital solutions that helped make itmore usable for disabled Veterans to check into medical appointments.But we had a lot of questions.  Are we able to design for the range of types and severity of disabilities?  Would some solutions only benefit some Veterans, while introducing barriers to others?  How do we decide on those trade-offs?We created an Accessibility Use Case MapAn accessibility use case map is a framework to evaluate proposed solutionsacross multiple different types of disabilities affecting Veterans. Weconsidered both digital and non-digital solutions for each phase of the check-in process.A spreadsheet makes it accessibleAs we note later in the article, we worked with an accessibility specialistwho uses a screen-reader. We chose to design the map in a spreadsheet. Thismade it easy for our colleague to offer feedback. Figure 3: Exampleof accessibility use case map. Solutions are indicated on the x-axis. All ninedisabilities are listed on the y-axis. Each solution is assessed for degree ofimpact: impactful, helpful, it depends, not relevant, and inaccessible. Thiscriteria is discussed later in this article.  We wanted our map to help prioritize solutions that maximized benefits forVeterans living with a variety of disabilities, while minimizing the chancesof introducing barriers.Here&#39;s how we created the accessibility use case map.Step 1: Developed proto-personas for each type of disabilityWe chose nine of the most common types of disabilities reported by Veterans:  Blindness  Low vision  Hard of hearing/deafness  Cognitive disability  PTSD  Motor disabilities  Military Sexual Trauma (MST)  DeafblindnessTime and resources were limited. So we used secondary sources and &quot;bestestimates&quot; to develop light-weight personas of each disability type ( proto-personas).Each described the behavior, symptoms, needs, and tools used to manage thecondition. This allows for quicker, iterative research. Figure 4: Exampleof a proto-persona for a Veteran living with low-vision. We used secondaryresearch sources to validate our assumptions on behaviors, needs andchallenges. Details of the post-it notes are intentionally not-visible, andare shown for example purposes only.Step 2: Created user journey maps to identify pain points and possible solutionsBased on the proto-personas, we created user journey maps across the medicalappointment experience:  Before checking into an appointment  During the appointment, and;  After the appointmentWe proposed solutions to help address pain points across the journey for eachtype of disability. Figure 5: Exampleof user journey map for a Veteran living with low vision and may needcaregiver support to prepare for the medical appointment. Details of the post-it notes are intentionally not-visible, and are shown for example purposesonly.Step 3: Mapped each solution across multiple disability types, creating our accessibility use case mapBut what might benefit someone with one type of disability, might be a barrierfor others. For instance, text-to-speech software is helpful for a blindVeteran trying to access their appointments. But it may be inaccessible to aVeteran who is hard of hearing.Due to this challenge, we decided to map each proposed solution across the 9most common disabilities affecting Veterans.We listed recommendations along the x-axis. We then listed the ninedisabilities along the y-axis.For each type of disability, we assessed if the solution was:  Impactful (positive and we believe will enhance the experience for this disability)  Helpful (positive and it&#39;s not specific to this disability)  It Depends (it may depend on the degree or type of disability, or the recommendation is too complex for us to weigh in at this point)  Not Relevant  Inaccessible (it&#39;s a barrier for a person with this disability)Step 4: Iterated with various accessibility expertsTime constraints didn&#39;t allow us to validate with users (which would&#39;ve beenideal). Instead, we iterated on our map with various accessibilityspecialists:  Josh Kim (Accessibility Designer)  Martha Wilkes ( Accessibility Strategist at the VA Office of the Chief Technology Office)  Melissa Manak (Senior User Experience Mobile Designer)  Angela Fowler (Senior A11Y Specialist and Designer)  Vanessa Luxen (an IAAP certified professional and former Audiologist at CivicActions)Some of the experts we consulted also lived with a disability. This helpedensure we were including the lived experiences of the very people we weredesigning for.Step 5: Developed an &quot;Accessibility Impact Score&quot; for each recommendation.Working with our accessibility experts, we assigned a value depending on howhelpful or unhelpful the solution was for each type of disability. We calledthis our &quot;Accessibility Impact Score.&quot;  3 for Impactful (positive and we believe will enhance the experience for this disability)  2 for Helpful (positive and it is not specific to this disability)  1 for It Depends (it may depend on the degree of type of disability, or the recommendation is too complex for us to weigh in at this point)  0 for Not Relevant  -2 for Inaccessible (it is a barrier for a person with this disability)We then tallied the number of scores for each solution to calculate the final&quot;Accessibility Impact Score.&quot;This helped us assign a numerical value to evaluate the impact eachrecommendation would have across multiple disabilities. For instance,improvements like &quot;sending an SMS notification with a link to pre-check-in&quot;was one of our highest impact solutions. This meant it was impactful for thegreatest number of disabilities.Step 6: Prioritized recommendations based on the Accessibility Impact ScoreUsing a prioritization matrix, we prioritized each recommendation based on itstotal Accessibility Impact Score.We refined it further with our product team based on scope and feasibility, sowe could eventually choose the recommendations we wanted on our roadmap.We took some risks and made many assumptionsThere are many caveats with our framework, for instance:  It favors specific solutions that are impactful for a few disabilities and may end up with a lower score vs. general solutions that help a variety of disabilities.  We did not capture the complexity within each disability type. For example, cognitive disabilities can include a range of disabilities that vary in severity, symptoms and more. We recognize disabilities are not a monolith and the experiences are complex and varied.  It doesn&#39;t take user preferences or familiarity with the technology into account  It&#39;s not intersectional — it doesn&#39;t consider people who live with more than one disability  We didn&#39;t test it with users living with disabilities.  This is our first attempt at designing for disabled Veterans when resourcesare limited, time-frames are tight, and priorities conflict.Ideally, disabled Veterans would be part of our processWhat would we have done differently without those constraints? We would haveincluded disabled Veterans throughout all six steps of the process. This waywe&#39;d design with (not for ) the disabled Veteran community.What&#39;s next?This framework is dynamic. We plan to continue to iterate as we address ourmany assumptions. We hope to start conducting user research sessions withVeterans living with disabilities to validate (and invalidate) our proposedimprovements.Authors: Nira Datta, Senior Content Designer at CivicActions; Ya-ching Tsao,Product Designer at CivicActionsHelping disabled Veterans Check-In: Designing an AccessibilityMap was originally published inCivicActions on Medium, where people arecontinuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

The following tools help us keep the quality of our site high.To achieve the testing we use the following technologies:  remark: A markdown processor (Markdown is how we write all our content that is then compiled into static HTML pages by Jekyll).  retext: A natural language processor to check for issues in the text.  reviewdog: Takes the errors and warnings from remark and retext and comments on the markdown text in the code (pull request) indicating the issues and recommended corrections.  pre-commit: Also test files for any issues and in some cases updates the text automatically.  docker and GitHub Actions: Used to run the reviewdog scripts with remark and retext whenever a pull request is submitted.The setupFor remark/retext we create a Docker image that installs the dependencies and sets up reviewdog to execute our configuration on a pull request. The details are visible in our repository but here are the important bits.The following files (truncated for brevity) configure the plugins for testing markdown and text — and their individual settings.Here are some of our example settings:  Markdown bullets denoted with an asterisk &#39;*&#39;.  Single space between sentences.  Straight quotes (note this down, it will be important later in the post).  Readability set to 18 years.  Checking for spelling mistakes.  Checking for insensitive or inconsiderate language.remarkrc.problem file:{  &quot;settings&quot;: {    &quot;listItemIndent&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,    &quot;bullet&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,    &quot;strong&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,    &quot;emphasis&quot;: &quot;_&quot;,    &quot;fences&quot;: true  },  &quot;plugins&quot;: [      &quot;remark-frontmatter&quot;,      &quot;remark-validate-links&quot;,      &quot;remark-comment-config&quot;,...

The setup is also tuned to only check the changes for the text issues and not all files. This encourages authors to focus on the changes they are submitting.ExamplesIn pull request 373 and the below screenshot you can see that the sentence, &quot;Whole websites can now be easily crawled for bugs&quot; that the word &#39;easily&#39; has been flagged as may be insensitive and we should try to avoid it.In pull request 374 and the below screenshots you can see that I took an earlier version of this post and ran it through the process and got some good feedback.In this screenshot we see a warning about a hard to read sentence.In this screenshot we see that a typo was misattributed as an insensitive word.Automating changesSome of the recommendations that are provided could be automatically edited, like changing smart quotes to straight quotes (remember the note from earlier). We do this using the pre-commit tool and here is an example:In this screenshot we see a warning about a smart quote:In this screenshot the change is made for us and committed to the pull request:You can see the details at this URL: pull request 342.Future considerationsWe are interested in adding the retext-simplify plugin to check phrases for simpler alternatives and maybe reduce the age for readability. Check out the available plugins in the retext documentation.ConclusionFollowing this set-up can help you inject tools to help you test your content. But remember, automation can be devoid of context and can still contain our biases.You should keep tweaking the tools and double-check your content to make sure it meets your values.Further reading and examples  The same tools above are used in:          Quality docs.

      "content"  : "Today is the Global Accessibility Awareness Day or GAAD, and people around the world organize events to raise awareness about digital accessibility. Especially as everything is online these days, GAAD has become something that celebrate throughout the month of May.2020 was the 10th anniversary, and also the launch of the GAAD Foundation.I represented Drupal in Funka&#39;s We4Authors Accessibility Cluster. Yesterday, Funka organized a pre-GAAD event to highlight the importance of authoring tools.The We4Authors Cluster is a multi-CMS (Content Management System) group that is working to better support authors. Authors need to be subject matter experts, not accessibility experts, and CMS tools can help make their job easier. It should be simple for everyone to produce accessible content. For folks familiar with the W3C&#39;s Web Accessibility Initiative, it is essentiallylooking at implementing Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 - Part B. By bringing together leaders in CMS solutions that are popular with governments in the European Union, we are finding solutions which can help many of the authors that will need to implement the European Union&#39;s Web Accessibility Directive.The challenge that governments face to see that their digital solutions are able to meet the needs of all citizens is significant. By working together and funding common solutions to widely used libraries the European Commission is able to make a very cost-effective contribution to improving accessibility. Millions of citizens in member states will benefit from having better accessibility defaults.Both proprietary &amp;amp; open source communities were involved in the We4Authors Cluster and both can help develop common best practices.It was also terrific to see the efforts that the organizers placed on accessibility for this event. A live captionist was engaged for the event. That text was automatically translated into multiple languages so that representatives in non-English speaking countries could participate.Building in accessibility best practices can really help so many people engage with digital content. Everyone can benefit, whether they have a disability or not.",

      "content"  : "On Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we&#39;re excited to be announcing the launch of our initiative to advance accessibility awareness and best practices in government digital services.Photo by PorapakApichodilokfrom PexelsPeople tend to think of disability as a characteristic of a person. But often,the mismatch between design and the person is what causes the disability. Intoday&#39;s tech-driven world, designing and building for people with differentabilities enables more of society to access essential services. It makes for amore inclusive world.Creating accessible websites is a growingpriority within the [Biden Administration&#39;s] government.But accessibility goes beyond compliancerequirements. It&#39;s something we canconsider at every step of a service, holistically across government, tobenefit the greatest possible number of people.That&#39;s why we launched the CivicActions Accessibility Practice Area, toestablish a community of learning and growth around accessibility bestpractices. It&#39;s something we all need to work on, from the vendors buildingdigital services to the agencies delivering them to the public. And this workis never &quot;done&quot; — we know there is always more to do, and we invite everyoneto do it with us.Building a foundation for accessibility best practicesWe&#39;re working on embedding accessibility into our offerings by:  Developing a proactive, interactive process to make government services accessible to everyone, called the Holistic Enterprise Accessibility Review Technique (HEART)  Incorporating accessibility into our human-centered design process at CivicActions, ensuring that our design practices integrate accessibility into our client work  Building accessibility personas to drive our design thinking, and building our &#39;designer&#39;s accessibility toolkit&#39; with templates to guide each phase of the decision making process  Exploring how we might incorporate plain language service training  Creating recommendations on how to structure project teams to include accessibility from the start  Integrating accessibility into our processes and workflows, including company materials like our handbook, contracts, and proposalsPhoto by JuditaTamošiūnaitėfrom PexelsWe&#39;re passionate about fixing problems &quot;at the source&quot;, which has led us tofocus on improving legacy procurement — right where many accessibilityproblems begin. We&#39;re currently developing an open, machine-readable templateto help organizations show how well their product meets accessibilitystandards. It&#39;s our version of the current standard, known as VoluntaryProduct Accessibility Template (VPAT). We hopeit will provide a better alternative for agencies looking to accurately gaugethe accessibility of the products they are considering.Creating a community hub for accessibilityTo help build enthusiasm and education around accessibility, we developed anopen source website with resourcesand best practices. It serves as a digital hub for our growing community.We&#39;re already seeing a growing interest in the conversation on improving theaccessibility of government services. We&#39;ve presented at the General ServicesAdministration (GSA) Accessibility Guild and the GSA has incorporated ourautomated testing solution on their website.We&#39;re also talking about:  Why we need accessibility compliance as code  How to integrate accessibility early and throughout your process  Why anchor links are a must for government agencies  How to run automated testing on your GitHub-hosted Jekyll site  Why open-source collaboration is key to busting silosWe&#39;re using and building on a range of government accessibility sourcesincluding the United States Web Design System (USWDS), 18F, and the UK&#39;sGovernment Digital Services. We&#39;re beginning to influence the conversation too(our automated testing solution is now part of 18F&#39;splaybook). This justshows how we can all work together to build a stronger global community ofdigital services professionals who all want to make a more accessible world.Building capacity in our own organizationIt can be difficult informing busy professionals about accessibility. To adoptnew ways of thinking and working as an organization, you have to embedaccessibility as part of the culture. So our community of practice also servesas an internal accessibility support team. We want to make it easier for ourcolleagues to grow their knowledge and expertise. To drive internal education,we:  Maintain an accessibility playbook and guide with a focus on open source solutions serving government  Promote and educate about solutions that are relevant, scalable, and reliable  Treat accessibility questions within the organization like a customer support ticket, making it easy for our colleagues to ask questions and get help  Run an accessibility study group within the organization to develop professional skills in accessibility (and work towards certification)  Host a Slack channel to discuss current events and articles on accessibilityThecommunity of practice helps us build a culture of accessibility in our ownorganization and beyond.Collectively, this helps us build accessibility confidence within theorganization, so CivicActioners can more readily apply it to projects.Measuring successThere are plenty of metrics to measure how we&#39;re advancing our mission. As weramp up, we are strategically choosing to measure our success through:  Impact through our new accessibility site, which is emerging as a useful resource and establishing credibility  Growth of accessibility as a service that we provide to the government, as evidenced by the number of submissions on our contact form and traffic to the accessibility service pages (which we&#39;ll be publishing soon!)  Expansion of our practice area, specifically by the number of members and engagements in weekly meetings  Increase of feedback on our accessibility statement, which helps us understand how we can better meet the needs of our visitors.Some folks in theCivicActions Accessibility community of practice.How we workNobody has all the answers.

He&#39;s passionate about changingthe conversation around accessibility in civic tech by moving beyondcompliance to view these needs for what they are: a humanright.Senior Strategist Mike Gifford in his natural habitatThe world of civic tech is deep and wide. Why accessibility? What approachshould we be taking as we attempt to learn about issues within theaccessibility community?Photo of Alan and Mike, courtesy of Mike&#39;sFlickrMike: For me, it started with ** empathy and friendship. Alan Shain,who&#39;s been a roommate and friend since 1990, has cerebral palsy. He&#39;s a formerbureaucrat and a comic who has been active in the Canadian arts community.He&#39;s taught me the importance of the disability rights movement. Knowing himgot me thinking more about humanity and the abilities we possess, and thenotion that we are all only &quot;temporarily able-bodied.&quot; We have some abilitiesright now, but that may change drastically tomorrow. As we grow older, thingsinevitably happen to our bodies. Yet, we have a big aversion to the idea ofour own mortality, so we often overlook that.  &quot;We are all only temporarily able-bodied — we have some abilities rightnow, but that may change drastically tomorrow.&quot;Through many conversations with Alan, I&#39;ve become more appreciative of howother people move through this world. There&#39;s much more to accessibility thanpeople realize. It helps to open our minds and consider that there aretemporary and situational disabilities, such as ones caused by medications, oreven by losing your glasses. You could have trouble doing your taxes becauseyou have to care for your children, or because you&#39;re simply struggling tojuggle more than one thing at a time. You could be trying to access a websitewith low contrast while outside on a sunny day. These are all examples ofaccessibility issues.  &quot;There are temporary disabilities and situational ones, such as onescaused by medications, or even by losing your glasses.&quot;PerfectoCapucineon UnsplashWhen you think about web accessibility, what are some common misconceptionsor mistakes you see? How can they be addressed?A lot of people assume things are accessible, when in fact they are not. TakeDrupal&#39;s website, for example. People assume that Drupal.org is accessible,and therefore, no other work needs to be done. While Drupal has some built-inaccessibility features, there are other issues that aren&#39;t coming to light.I would love to have people adopt the mindset that accessibility featuresshould be included from the start, and not as an afterthought. Wanting to bemore accessible today than yesterday should always be the goal. This meansbuilding frameworks that pave the way for inclusive, forward-thinkingpractices. We&#39;re dealing with something that changes all the time, so it&#39;sabout more than just performance. We need to be constantly finding ways ofbringing more people into the conversation; we&#39;re excluding far too manypeople.  &quot;I would love to have people adopt the mindset that accessibility featuresshould be included from the start, and not as an afterthought.&quot;What changes have you seen over time in this industry?The number of educational resources addressing accessibility issues hasincreased significantly. And they are much more timely and interesting than adecade ago, when the conversation first shifted towards these issues.For example, tools like axe accessibilitytesting provide more opportunities to uncoverproblematic issues on websites. It would be great if we could monitor thoseinstances even more. In Europe the government is tasked with monitoring theaccess of all public websites. The results have to be published, which holdsthem accountable to the standards they set, and increases the transparency ofexisting issues. If a department scores low on accessibility compliance,people will know, and expect a response. It&#39;s like checkers! The good thing isthat there are standard automated tools that can trawl websites and show whereimprovements can be made.AndyFeliciottion UnsplashWhere do you see web accessibility going in the future? Do you have any&quot;big bets&quot; when it comes to emerging technologies or trends?I think ** VR and augmented reality will have a big impact soon. We&#39;re atthe edge of them being more meaningfully included in our lives. It would begreat for engagement — an interactive way to start thinking about how to makeemerging technologies more accessible. Computers are built into so manydevices, but they still contain significant impairments. Washing machines andother appliances could be adapted to be more intuitive, too.For people reading this, how can they be part of the solution?Ask questions and explore what&#39;s out there. Educate yourself, and spend timetrying to understand how other people interact with the web and how importantthat access is to all of us. Look into features like the Wave toolbar andaccessibility insights from Microsoft to get a sense of accessibility issuesthat others face. These tools are great for evaluating and aiding in awarenessof the existing problems, and are structured to give users a visual cue ofwhere they might be.Also, try to make the conversation about accessibility personal. Ask peopleabout the needs their parents might have as they age. What general challengeswill they face? For example, when you&#39;re younger, it&#39;s easier for you tomemorize things. but that changes as we age. Show people how we face similarchallenges at different points in our lives, and normalize addressing thoseconcerns now rather than later. That said, there are one in five peoplesuffering from permanent disabilities, so the probability of you knowingsomeone with one is very high.  &quot;Try to make the conversation about accessibility personal.&quot;Why should the government prioritize web accessibility in procurement?Government is the largest single purchaser of goods and services, so as anentity, it has a huge impact on setting accessibility standards for everyoneelse. If the government commits to only buying accessible tech, it will changethe world. Currently though, the federal government often favors certaincorporations, or software or tools that have barriers to accessibility.  &quot;If the government commits to only buying accessible tech, it will changethe world.&quot;ThisisEngineeringRAEngon UnsplashDo you see open source software as a way to improve accessibility atscale?Yes, using open source tools can actually be part of an accessibilitystrategy for a government organization.For example, Drupal issues can affect a million websites that use it, butbecause it is open source, fixing issues in the Drupal core fixes themeverywhere — the scalability is huge. With proprietary software, you&#39;ll haveto cobble together your best hope of an answer to any issues that arise. Youmay not be able to share information outside of a silo because of bureaucraticor intellectual property issues with the software you are being forced to use.  &quot;Open source tools can actually be part of an accessibility strategy for agovernment organization.&quot;It&#39;s more efficient to work in open source because when we get it right, itscales. The cost to the taxpayer for methods using proprietary software isunsustainable; there&#39;s no way to share the wisdom. Everyone is struggling tofind the same solutions to problems, and they end up cobbling somethingtogether instead of working effectively. Open source tech allows you toexplore all your options and get the best answer to a problem, because youhave a whole community supporting it. If you have questions about something,and the community answers them for you, it&#39;s being answered for everyone else,too.Learn more  Mike Gifford at DrupalCon Global 2020  Challenges in automating accessibility  Writing impactful accessibility reports  Accessibility initiatives from the White House  How open source tools improve accessibility for governmentConnect with Mike  LinkedIn  GitHub  Medium  TwitterQ&amp;amp;A with Mike Gifford: Accessibility in civictech was originally published inCivicActions on Medium, where people arecontinuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "content"  : "We launched the CivicActions Accessibility practice area and its accompanying website in January 2021.Our intent is for the practice area to be an open project and community for CivicActions team members, and the broader digital government service industry, including clients, partners, government contractors, and generally anyone who wants to improve accessibility on the web.Practicing what we preachWe realized early on that if we were going to be truly inclusive with our work and provide accessibility resources to the broader community, we should strive to make the website as accessible as possible.While we acknowledge that automated testing isn&#39;t a panacea, it&#39;s one way to address accessibility issues quickly and at scale.Using GitHub and open source technology – general and accessibility-specific – we created a continuous accessibility integration environment that helps us better practice what we preach.Our technology and accessibility &quot;stack&quot;We proudly leverage open source technologies wherever possible, and all of these tools used here meet that criteria.The site is powered by Jekyll and U.S. Web Design System, specifically the U.S. Web Design System Jekyll theme maintained by 18F and the USWDS team. The site is hosted through GitHub Pages.We added automated accessibility testing using GitHub Actions and pa11y-ci with axe.Configuring Jekyll with a sitemap and npmWe recommend adding a sitemap.xml generator to Jekyll which will be used by pa11y-ci to test all pages. We use the jekyll-sitemap plugin.We recommend using npm to manage the pa11y-ci packages and commands.

Then the steps will:  Check out the source code.  Install the Jekyll Ruby dependencies but caches them so that subsequent runs can go faster.  Install the pa11y-ci dependencies via npm.  Start the webserver as we did locally.  Run pa11y-ci to test the site and capture the output to a file.*  Read the file to a variable so that we can use it in the next step.*  Send the results of the file to the pull request as a comment in a &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; collapsed element.*  Check the output for failures and &quot;hard fail&quot; the action.** Capturing the output to a file and commenting on the pull request are optional features and could be harder to maintain. You can simply run the pa11y-ci commands and view the results in the action output.Here is an example screenshot of the GitHub action run of pa11y-ci tests (taken from pull request #127 checks):Here is an example screenshot of the comments added to a pull request (taken from pull request #137 comment):SummaryUsing the above steps, you can quickly get your GitHub-hosted Jekyll site automatically tested for accessibility issues, but remember, automatic tests are not a panacea.As noted in our playbook for automated testing:  … no matter the tool, automated testing only catches about one-third of accessibility issues, so it cannot be relied upon to determine if a site complies. To better ensure that their digital tools are accessible to keyboard-only and assistive technology users, automated tests need to be done along with a robust manual testing plan.Further reading and examples  Automated accessibility testing with Travis CI  How to Automate Web Accessibility Testing  Examples of applying the above steps to Jekyll sites:          BBC&#39;s &quot;Accessibility, News and You&quot;.

      "content"  : "Praise and recommendations for the accessibility statement published by the new administrationWith the inauguration on January 20, 2021, the [Biden Administration&#39;s] WhiteHouse.gov team released a newwebsite. A noticeable and well received feature of the new site is that itonce again has an accessibilitystatement which is linked in thefooter of every page — a best practice that demonstrates this administration&#39;scommitment to serving all Americans of all abilities.The short-but-aspirational statement makes it clear that this is just thebeginning, and that the White House team will continue working to build a sitethat is accessible and usable by folks who are challenged by impairments,using assistive devices, or facing situational barriers that make it harder tonavigate online.  The statement serves as an initial step toward making the website, and allservices, accessible to the greatest number of people possible.The statement serves as an initial step toward making the website, and allservices, accessible to the greatest number of people possible. It&#39;s clearthat this administration isn&#39;t just aiming for compliance with the currentrequirements of the recently-refreshed Section 508guidelines, but going the full extent to align with WCAG 2.1AA — the latest W3Crecommendation and the standard beginning to be adopted by governmentsworldwide.An even better statement: suggestions for improvementWhile the newly released accessibility statement is a laudable first step,it&#39;s understood to be a work-in-progress. Everyone working on digital productsand projects for public services should be continually looking foropportunities to make them more accessible, and the White House statementspecifically invites comments on ways to improve. Our recommendations include:Make it easy to get in touchTo make it easier for people to flag problems with the site or give feedback,more ways to get in touch could be offered. There are currently several phonenumbers listed (including some for hearing impaired folks — well done!), but aweb form, email address, or even Twitter account could be added to allow usersto digitally submit ways to improve the site. After all, some people are non-verbal, and others might feel a bit shy about picking up the phone and callingthe White House!Additionally, digital feedback options can capture browser and operatingsystem information and allow people to upload screenshots, which makesdebugging easier. Email and Twitter can be used to gather information into acommon issue queue to manage feedback and make sure that issues are identifiedand fixed in a timely manner.Address the whole White House experienceThe accessibility statement could be expanded to provide users withinformation about the accessibility features of the White House itself, notjust the website. For example, when we are able to do White House tours again,where will visitors go to find out if there is an accessible washroom? Theremay also be mobile apps that fall under the White House management that needto be covered in accessibility considerations. Thinking about all aspects ofservices (digital and physical) can help agencies provide the most holisticaccessible experience to everyone.  Thinking about all aspects of services (digital and physical) can helpagencies provide the most holistic accessible experience to everyone.Account for accessibility limitationsRecognizing that accessibility is a journey that never ends, it&#39;s important toacknowledge where there are limitations that impaired people may encounterbreakdowns in accessibility. For example, if users navigate to archivedpages of the website, they will likely find them less accessible than thecurrent pages that are being brought up to an improved standard.Legacy files and videos may also be found lacking in accessibility. Ifthere is published content that isn&#39;t accessible but is still being served upto people, the statement can identify it, and explain if there is a processfor requesting that the material be provided in an accessible format.  Recognizing that accessibility is a journey that never ends, it&#39;s importantto acknowledge where there are limitations that impaired people mayencounter breakdowns in accessibility.And of course there is the challenge of the ever-beloved-by-government PDFfiles. Will the WhiteHouse.gov team be continuing to use PDF files, orfollowing the model that the UK hasrecommended? If PDFs will be used, is there a plan formaking them accessible, or providing the information in an additional formatthat is accessible? Will large print versions be made available, or only onrequest? These are all questions that can be addressed in a robustaccessibility statement.Show how the sausage is madeAccessibility and transparency are closely linked. There is an opportunityhere to provide visibility into how WhiteHouse.gov is built, which can promotebetter understanding and usability for everyone. The White House could explainthat the site is built with WordPress and that they are following theaccessibility best practicesdefined in the WordPress community. This includes using a plug-in that allowsusers to switch between high/low contrast, as well as change the font size.Many people still don&#39;t know about darkmode, or how they can configure it by default in theirbrowser.If the site is built on the United States Web DesignSystem (USWDS), it would be useful tohighlight this. This is a U.S. Government framework that has been extensivelytested for accessibility best practices. It may be worth noting that the WhiteHouse is committed to keeping up with the USWDS and will be applying updatesto this framework to keep up-to-date with security/accessibility bestpractices. If there are deviations from the standard implementation, thiscould be explained.It would be also important to know what is the testing process used internallyin the WhiteHouse.gov team. Are automated tools used? Are new features testedwith people who have lived experience with disability? Does the team test forkeyboard-only users? Has anyone checked what happens to text if someone zoomsin their browser to enlarge 300%? Explaining the extent of testing that hasbeen done will allow people to predict what level of accessibility they mayfind for their own particular needs when using WhiteHouse.gov.Accessibility statement best practicesFor the White House team, and for all of us working to create digital servicesthat are usable by the greatest number of people, there are guidelines tohelp. If any team is looking to start with a robust accessibility statement,they may start with the advice of accessibility expert Denis Boudreau, whosummarized the four essential elements of an accessibilitystatement. Itshould have:  Statement of intention to best serve people with disabilities  Reference to the standards followed (usually WCAG 2.0 AA)  Examples of accessible implementations on their site  How to reach out with comments or requests for helpAccessibility expert Karl Groves outlined alist that adds: &quot;What are you doing tosupport and improve accessibility?&quot; as an important element. Lainey Feingold,a well respected legal accessibility expert, has suggested that an idealaccessibility statement would also includereferences to an organization&#39;s accessibility policies and include informationabout other accessibility services. Web accessibility firm Microassistdeveloped a useful checklist for gettingstarted.The W3C has an accessibility statementgenerator whichadds in section for technical information that might help a user betternavigate the site. Disability:IN and the UK&#39;s Government DigitalService have also produced some excellent guides. The accessibilitystatement page, perhaps more than any other page, should be kept current sopeople can access accurate information — and of course it should be made asaccessible as possible!A website for all peopleIt is encouraging to see what the new administration has done to emphasize theimportance of accessibility, even in the first weeks after the inauguration.There is a real commitment from the Biden team to meet the needs of allpeople, clearly including the 20% that have disabilities. The web team behindthe White House site — like all of us who are working in support of governmentdigital services — have a significant challenge ahead, but an equallysignificant obligation to do the hard work and always be improving.

      "content"  : "How agencies can adopt an open source strategy to make their services more usable by people of all abilitiesPhoto by TimMossholderon UnsplashGovernment agencies, of all organizations, have perhaps the greatestobligation to plan for the accessibility of theirwebsites anddigital services. Beyond meeting compliance requirements for accessibility,mission-focused agencies want to make sure the greatestnumber of people — regardless of ability — can use and understand theimportant content and services provided online.There&#39;s a tendency to think only of permanently &quot;disabled&quot; people when we talkabout accessibility, but it&#39;s an issue that extends to a large portion of thepopulation. Temporary and situational disabilities can affect all of us fromtime-to time — as we find ourselves with an injured hand or out on a sunny daytrying to read our phones. And of course, some of the people that most needgovernment services may also face some of the greatest barriers in accessingdigital content — such as English Language Learner immigrants, low-incomefamilies with limited access to Internet devices, the aging populationreceiving Medicare, or Veterans struggling with mental health challenges.Meeting the needs of people with varying abilities and backgrounds is a multi-layered issue requiring conscious decisions around technology and process inorder to get it right. This means government digital platforms should be builtwith accessibility in mind, using modern tools and practices that willconstantly improve instead of falling out of date.  Meeting the needs of people with varying abilities and backgrounds is amulti-layered issue requiring conscious decisions around technology andprocess.CivicActions has long been a proponent of open sourcetechnologies and agilepractices, which provide many benefits to government agencies, including anaccessibility advantage. Here are four recommendations for an open sourcestrategy that will set agencies up for success in the goal of providing modernand accessible digital services.Use tools that are ready-made for accessibilityIt only makes sense to start on the right foot by using tools that havealready been tested for accessibility — otherwise you are beginning with a lotof technical debt. Your team will be responsible for finding and fixing allthe errors, and continually monitoring anything that&#39;s built to make sure thesystems continue to be functional for groups that depend on you foraccessibility (e.g., people who use assistive technologies like screenreaders).Open source platforms such as Drupal (for websitecontent management) and the U.S. Web DesignStandards (USWDS) (for designinggovernment websites) are already evaluated against the newly updated Section508 requirements and have been extensively tested against the World WideWeb Consortium&#39;s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0AA. The combination ofthese tools for government websites provides an accessibility boost from theget-go. Accessibility is a complicated issue, so using platforms that arecontinually maintained by the open source community is smarter than trying toapply &quot;quick fixes&quot; to problems as they are discovered — which can put yourorganization at risk.  Open source platforms like Drupal and USWDS are built to meet accessibilitystandards as they evolve.CivicActions engineers and designers have been working on the pairing ofDrupal and USWDS since the design standards were initially released, knowingthese open source tools would be a powerful combination for agencies lookingto bring their systems up to date. From presenting about the benefits of thispairing when building government sites, toco-maintaining a USWDS base theme inDrupal, we&#39;re committed to helping agencies make the most of these platformsin their modernization efforts.Choose an agile approachWhether you&#39;re modernizing a legacy system, building something new, orimproving current operations, an agile approach is best for keepingaccessibility at the forefront. This is our go-to process for any work withgovernment clients, because the iterative cycles allow barriers to beidentified and resolved early in the process — saving time and money in theend. Agile also pairs well with an open source strategy, because open sourcetools evolve constantly as improvements are made by people who are using them.With all team members working in an agile manner:  Designers can quickly identify potential accessibility problems in their prototypes  Content authors can check for readability (and compatibility with assistive technology)  Developers can use automated accessibility tools to catch issues before code is committed to the repositoryAnd this can all happen before clients even see prototypes, let alone beforehuge systems are put in place that would be time-consuming and expensive tofix if accessibility issues were uncovered later. Our years of experience withopen source tools (especially Drupal) have shown that agile allows forcomprehensive testing at every stage of a project in addition to theopportunity to benefit from work that others have done — which improves theoverall accessibility, security, and usability of technology systems.Plan for the futureThe web is evolving quickly. Browsers, standards, and use-cases change overtime. And agencies will increasingly see people accessing their websites andservices through new technologies that depend on semanticcontent inorder to work well — which adds plenty of layers to the accessibilitychallenge.For example, Google search results glean information about organizations fromstructured site content. The use of assistant technologies like Siri, Alexa,and Google Home will make voice recognition a growing interface to considerfrom an accessibility perspective. And Virtual / Augmented Reality willcontinue to grow in popularity, meaning that government sites will need to beaccessible not just through home browsers, but through mobile devices, cardashboards, home speakers, and other AI.All this means that no &quot;accessibility checklist&quot; will ensure your site meetsits accessibility requirements next year, or in five years. So it&#39;s importantto view accessibility as a journey, not a destination. Agencies should planfor the future by establishing a strong foundation that will allow them toevolve their accessibility efforts for years to come — without having to scrapold technologies and start over!  Accessibility is a journey, not a destination.One way to do this is through open source tools like Drupal and USWDS, whichare constantly improved as maintainers and organizations contribute updatesand fixes. As technology evolves, these tools keep up, making it easier tomaintain accessibility over time. That&#39;s part of the reason Drupal is trustedby leading disability organizations like the National Federation of the Blind.For government, as well, Drupal provides a platform for managing web contentthat is built for accessibility and will continue to evolve along with theonline behavior of constituents.Be part of the communityCommunity contributions are the driving force that make open source tools soadaptable. Unlike proprietary software that is owned and maintained by oneentity, open source tools are owned by everyone and can be improved by anyone.More government organizations are adopting this open approach to technology asa way to share helpful code with other agencies and the public — while also gaining a communityof support upstream as open source software libraries are continually updated.Particularly with Drupal and USWDS, which are heavily used by government,accessibility improvements are made whenever barriers to users are identified.This makes it easier for all agencies using these tools to implementaccessibility best practices for their web content.  Open source tools like Drupal and USWDS make it easier for agencies toimplement accessibility best practices.CivicActions has cultivated and contributed to open source communities forover a decade. Their teams are actively using and improving Drupal and theU.S. Web Design System, working with agencies to make government services moreaccessible to everyone. Being part of these communities allows developers anddesigners to stay familiar with issue queues, create and test patches, andlearn from others who are using the same systems in different ways — so we canall shape these tools to be as functional, flexible, and useful as possible.As governments seek to make accessibility a priority in today&#39;s digital world,it makes sense to start with tools that are purpose-built to evolve along withtechnology systems and to be part of communities that care deeply aboutmeeting the needs of all users. Open source tools like Drupal and the U.S. WebDesign System can help you stay compliant with accessibility regulations, butalso to lay a strong foundation for a future in which people of all abilitiescan more easily benefit from the services you provide.CivicActions delights in helping agencies adapt these tools to betterfulfill their missions.

These reports are mainly used in government and education procurement, but can also be used by private sector organizations. During procurement, vendors are encouraged to create an ACR to show how an ICT meets the specific accessibility requirements that are being requested.An ACR is often created using a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), which comes in a few standard formats for reporting accessibility conformance. When evaluating our own work on websites, we use OpenACR along with the VPAT 2.5 WCAG (November 2023) template. OpenACR is a tool developed by CivicActions and maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA). To learn more about its development, read our case study.OpenACR reads and formats ACR results in YAML, a machine-readable format that can be easily stored and updated, and allows accessibility claims of digital products and services to be easily compared.

By leveraging open source best practices, we can benefit from much larger teams which have done extensive testing of their patterns.ColorThe website color palette is based on the USWDS color tokens.TechnologyThe pages on this website are primarily written in Markdown which substantially reduces the range of errors available in HTML. These are then compiled using Jekyll and presented to the user as structured HTML5. The site is hosted on GitHub, which has a very broad community of users who are free to to add issues or pull requests.We use axe-core with Pa11y to evaluate that every page follows basic accessibility best practices. Details for this are shared in our blog.Known issues  Open website accessibility issues  We can control the accessibility of the site, but not the accessibility of GitHub. GitHub is reasonably accessible, but is not currently seeking to be as accessible as this site.FeedbackIf you run into any accessibility barriers with this website, please contact us:  Email: accessibility-qa.civicactions.com  Submit an issue  Submit a pull request"

We use a project board to iteratively make progress on our goals, collaborate on issues, have open discussions, deliver a working site and respond to the changes that happen constantly in the world of accessibility.Accessibility and AgileWe encourage accessibility in every part of agile processes. Examples, adding inclusive user archetypes to design sprints, adding accessibility tests to the definition of done, demonstrating how a product is accessible in sprint reviews, prioritizing accessibility goals in retrospectives, delivering accessible product increments, and much more.Examples of places to encourage adoption of accessibility  Understanding accessibility needs in discovery.          Developing personas/archetypes that represent accessibility questions in design sprints.        Adding accessibility requirements to working agreement/definition of done.  Adding accessibility acceptance criteria to user stories.          Creating specific user stories for permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities.        Using accessibility testing tools:          Developing a feature locally.      Automated testing when pushing code to a branch or infrastructure.      Testing a feature in QA or production.        User accessibility testing after a feature/project delivery.  Doing manual testing.  Reviewing site-wide automated tests.

        "content"  : "CivicActions is a digital agency with the goal to **transform the way governments procure, develop, and deliver digital services**. We&#39;ve outlined our approach and learn about the broad range of services we offer at [CivicActions our central website](https://civicactions.com/approach). CivicActions has deep experience with open source software and agile development - both lend themselves to great accessibility practices. Our goals are audatious, but we have a talented team and aren&#39;t working in isolation. Because we are actively invovled in open communities, we are able to draw on and contribute to a vibrant, evolving ecosystem. This is necessary, if we are going to ensure that we are able to support our clients in building digital content that is more accessible today than it was yesterday. ## Basic servicesWe do offer training, technical reviews and monitoring services. We have considerable experience with remediating sites built on open source technology like Drupal. Collectively our team has over 500 years of experience with the Drupal community. Our team has played a key role in seeing that this Content Management System (CMS) is a leader in accessibility. We&#39;re involved in many other open source projects, and have have extensive experience leveraging open source communities to help our clients accomplish their needs. For any organization seeking to implement consistent, secure, user friendly and accessible experiences, open source provides unparralled flexibility. Very few organizations have our level of experience in maximizing usage of open source approaches to problem solving. We can help your software development teams bring accessibility into every sprint so that accessibility solutions are cheaper and more robust. By building accessibility into our process we can ensure that there aren&#39;t compliance surprises at the end of the project. ## Holistic approachesWe like to begin all of our accessibility work with an extensive discovery process that allows us to get a high-level perspective of the organization&#39;s accessibility maturity. This systems approach to accessibility includes user research and policy/practice evaluation so we can help your team identify the barriers in your site today, as well as to avoid the ones that otherwise would be introduced tomorrow. Borrowing from the best practices of Service Design, we know that giving people the right incentives and examples, is as important as having good tools and templates. Our team has a unique methodology to bring our deep technical understanding to build organization-wide strategies to embrace accessibility. The technical challenges of accessibility will only be addressed when we have accessibility confident organizations.

While it takes considerable experience to use a screen reader in the same way as the average daily user, incorporating basic screen reader testing into your accessibility test plan can still be quite effective in finding potential issues.There is considerable variation, even within the blind and low vision community, on how screen reader users navigate the web due to the wide range of vision related disabilities and technologies available. Each screen reader also has different default functionality and behaviors and can be customized to the user&#39;s preferences.

AI Image recognition for alt text is another example, where people are hoping to simply replace the human effort of writing a meaningful alt text.Jutta Treviranus has pioneered many important inclusion initiatives, and her work on AI is no exception. The edge cases are always going to be at a higher risk of being misunderstood while using machine learning. We need to shift our design approaches from merely satisfying 80% of the users, to build for the fringe. As with other minorities groups, people with disabilities are often disadvantaged with biased data.We can use machine learning to support accessibility, but in many cases it is better to approach it from the approach of Intelligence Augmented (IA). How do we use AI to support authors to produce better content. Perhaps it is by suggesting alt text for the author to review and modify (if needed). AI can also look for patterns in larger datasets than people can process to look for errors that a human would find difficult to pick out.Key questions  What algorithms are you using in your organization?

        "content"  : "Many of the accessibility errors on the web are accidentally produced by unsuspecting content editors. With the right processes and tools in place, we can make it easier to produce accessible content—and harder to publish inaccessible content.To start to address this issue, the EU recently commissioned Funka—a Swedish accessibility firm—to conduct a pilot called We4Authors on web authoring tools, producers and communities. The pilot evaluated several different Content Management Systems (CMS), including Drupal, to find ways to increase accessible publishing practices. What became clear, is that CMSs are currently contributing more to the problem than most are aware, by overlooking providing authors with support they need to produce accessible content. Many errors are a result of author inputs in the WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE, CKEditor, etc), and most web authors are not accessibility experts and so do not know the best practices to publish accessible content in their CMS. Most authors are not accessibility experts, and few have the time to go through the additional steps necessary to create accessible content.We4Authors demonstrates that many content producers and suppliers claim to deliver accessible content, many just don&#39;t understand accessibility. To make matters worse, CMSs are often not built from the author&#39;s perspective, which makes it hard to create accessible content and forces authors to navigate unintuitive publishing interfaces. Having a pleasant authoring experience isn&#39;t just a perk—it can greatly facilitate the production of accessible content—but unfortunately it&#39;s usually overlooked.The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0—a W3C Recommendation in 2015—is the most comprehensive approach to address the accessibility of authoring tools. Part A of the guidelines addresses the authoring interface to ensure that it too meets WCAG requirements, and Part B aligns directly with the goal of supporting authors in producing accessible content.Drupal 8 has worked to achieve many elements of both parts for ATAG 2.0 AA. More than any other popular CMS, Drupal&#39;s authoring environment is well-positioned to support authors with disabilities. Drupal has also implemented many measures to update the authoring experience and ensure more inclusive patterns are available to authors by default.ATAG 2.0 Part B identifies where a CMS can help authors create more accessible content. This doesn&#39;t remove the need for training, but should make it easier for people to implement best practices consistently. Government employees can&#39;t all be expected to be accessibility experts, but we can and must provide them with the right tools for creating accessible content.Checklist  Work to see that the authoring interface is accessible.  Feature ATAG 2.0 requirements as part of new technology procurement.  Simplify the authoring interface to make it easier for authors to make accessible content.  Include links to accessibility guidelines in help text where appropriate.Key questions  Are alt texts required? Can this be over-ridden for decorative images?  Are heading tags used semantically to describe the structure of the content?  Are authors given help on how to create accessible content (ie. how to write good alt text)?"

        "content"  : "OverviewAutomated testing can occur at different layers of the process of creating digital content:  Developers can run automated checks as part of their continuous integration (CI) process  Everyone can look at the accessibility of a single page  Editors can be given accessibility issues within a WYSIWYG editor  Whole websites can now be regularly crawled for bugs  Designers can evaluate problems with contrast issues in their designsAll of this is now possible with a range of proprietary and open source tools. With the rapid development of automated testing, there are now multiple options to gather information on a single website—or an entire government.A guide to automated testingChecklist  Continuous Integration tests incorporate accessibility tools like axe and errors block commits.  Patterns and pages are regularly reviewed to see that they test patterns available to authors.  Site-wide scans are used to track errors over time and catch both common and weird issues.  Creators of digital content all have some browser extension to quickly evaluate page-level accessibility.Key questions  Are you using a variety of automated testing tools to help identify potential problems?  How are you ensuring that you aren&#39;t relying too heavily on automated tests?  Have automated processes been set up to optimize use of developer time?Use Deque&#39;s aXe toolDeque&#39;s aXe has changed the playing field for site reviews. Because of its flexible design, it can be executed from the command line, from within the browser, or even from a WYSIWYG editor. Being executed from the command line means that it is much easier to simply add accessibility checking to any scripts that are being run. It can be appended to a script crawling to ensure security best practices are maintained, or simply added to a continuous integration script.Axe also provides highly structured and easily actionable error reports. These empower entities to pinpoint and categorize issues—from alt text to problems with the symantec structure and missing language. Axe is also already incorporating elements of WCAG 2.1.The Axe accessibility engine is now built into Google&#39;s Lighthouse, Microsoft&#39;s Accessibility Insights, and a host of other projects. Axe can also be applied to the web, Android and Windows testing. This provides a huge amount of flexibility for most software development teams.Government Digital Services in both the United Kingdom and Singapore have leveraged Deque&#39;s open-source axe-core accessibility engine to create tools that crawl and gather accessibility barriers for both public-facing websites and internal web-based communications. Similar open-source accessibility engines have been built by IBM &amp;amp; Deque, and there are proprietary tools available from firms like WebAim, Tenon &amp;amp; Siteimprove.Automated testing caveatHowever, it is important to note that, no matter the tool, automated testing only catches about one third of accessibility issues, so it cannot be relied upon to determine if a site complies. To better ensure that their digital tools are accessible to keyboard-only and assistive technology users, automated tests need to be done along with a robust manual testing plan.CivicActions ApproachCurrently CivicActions uses the following approaches that are open source.Pa11y CIPa11y CI is a continuous integration (CI) runner that can test a few pages or an entire site for accessibility issues. Our projects include Pa11y CI in their CI pipelines and generate reports as artifacts or comments with the results of the testing.We are currently testing this accessibility site using Pa11y CI and we blogged about it here and on opensource.com.Pa11y by default uses the HTML_CodeSniffer accessibility engine, but it is recommended to switch to Pa11y with axe, which is described in this UK Government Accessibility Manual.Cypress testing with the axe coreCypress is a JavaScript testing framework that is used for automated testing. Axe core is a popular accessibility testing engine. Our projects use cypress with the axe core to test components for accessibility issues.Take a look at Setting up Cypress with axe for accessibility article that illustrates the setup.

        "content"  : "The purpose of an accessibility checklist is to help identify accessibility issues in your product, website, or document. However, incorporating checklists into an accessibility strategy can often be tricky. One of the most common pitfalls when using or thinking about checklists is making sure you don&#39;t get stuck in a limited compliance mindset. There is no single checklist that covers all possible accessibility issues and as Intopia warned, a checklist mentality can actually be harmful for inclusion. That said, if approached as part of a broader strategy, they can be very helpful when used thoughtfully. Access Armada has some interesting suggestions on more strategic approaches to checklists.What makes a good accessibility checklist  The checklist should build on automated testing approaches.  Provide role-based checklists so that different people in the organization are focused on different aspects of accessibility.  Checklists should be short, concise and easily understood by the majority of the team.  Allow for iteration of the checklists is needed - they may need to change depending on the element or learnings after going through the process a few times.Example checklistsSometimes, you don&#39;t need to reinvent the wheel. If there&#39;s already an existing checklist available, you can customize it to fit the needs of your team and product. Below are a few examples of existing accessibility checklists:  W3C&#39;s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)          Basic checklist, not designed to be fully robust but rather to give you a starting point        18F - USA Government          Checklist geared toward US federal websites        A11yProject          Robust checklist using WCAG criteria and broken update into element categories (e.g. Content, Images, etc.) with understandable action items        Heydon Works          Checklist that includes not just items regarding accessibility but other inclusive design checks as well - device support, language, etc.        VoxMedia          Checklist broken down into categories for various practices area/role        Intopia&#39;s Accessibility Not-Checklist          This checklist can be customized directly on the site by specific WCAG standards and it can be filtered to display items by either topic or role      Create your own checklistWhile there are many checklists already out there and that can be customized to fit your needs, you don&#39;t necessarily need to use something preexisting. Using an existing automated scanning tool, you could create your own simple checklist process.For example, using a tool like WebAim&#39;s WAVE, organizations could create a checklist to:  Scan the page with the WAVE scanning tool. View the details tab of the results console:          Review each error - designated by a red box with an X      Review each alert - designated by an orange triangle with an exclamation point        Do manual testing of the page  Evaluate the page for plain language using free tools like the HemingwayApp.Next stepsWhen you are ready to learn more, here are some further guides and resources that may help:  Manual testing  Automated testing"

Working virtually allows some people with disabilities to excel. Often people with physical disabilities face barriers in traditional office environments which may not be able to provide an accessible office or sufficient accommodations to participate equally. By using video conferencing, slack, email and other online collaboration tools, our team is able to use a more customized workspace at home, and skip the need to commute to a central office.Unfortunately, there are also people with disabilities which are excluded from participating in many distributed teams. Many deaf and hard of hearing people find it more difficult to read lips or intentions through video conferencing tools. Blind users are blocked by the many visual organization tools like Trello &amp;amp; Mural that do not have good support for blind users. Many websites do not have sufficient support for even keyboard only users.Fortunately, there are things that we can do to change this. Most popular video conferencing tools now offer AI driven speech to text captioning. This isn&#39;t perfect, but is continuing to improve. There is more pressure for visual kanban &amp;amp; sticky note tools to build in greater accessibility. More people are thinking about accessibility before buying IT for their office.Another approach that some organizations are doing is helping to assign a minder to help people with disabilities navigate systems that are not fully accessible.

        "content"  : "A comprehensive accessibility testing plan must include manual testing. As automated testing generally only catches about 20-30% of accessibility errors, without manual testing the majority of issues are going to be missed.There are various types of manual testing that can be incorporated into your testing plan, some are easier than others to work in based on resources, expertise, available tools, etc. You can create your testing plan based on what works for you and your team; the most important thing is that some amount of manual testing is consistently part of the process.Keyboard testingKeyboard testing can catch a high volume of potential accessibility issues. Keyboard testing can identify if semantic elements were not used—which typically lead to larger issues with other devices. It can also identify if the reading order is incorrect and if there are keyboard traps on the page, among other issues.Keyboard testing is easy to do and requires no specific expertise or hardware—other than a keyboard—so this type of  testing can be shared among various project team members. It is one of the most important manual tests that should be included in any testing plan.To do keyboard testing:  Confirm that all interactive elements are available and actionable using the keyboard only.          Use TAB to move forward through the page and SHIFT + TAB to go backwards.      SPACE and ENTER are the most common keys to activate elements but for more custom elements WebAIM provides a good resource.        Confirm that while tabbing, all interactive elements have a visible focus indicator when receiving focus.          Typically, this is a colored border around the element.        Confirm that while tabbing, the order of tabbing moves logically through the page. It should follow a typical reading order - top to bottom, left to right.Zoom and resizingThe purpose of zoom testing is to confirm that at 200% there are no visual or functional issues from the page resizing. It is also important to specifically test text resizing, that it is working as expected.Zoom testing is another testing type that can be completed without any specialized hardware, software or expertise, making it relatively easy to add to a basic testing plan.To test content zoom:  Set your browser width to 1280 pixels.  Use CTRL + or CMD + to zoom in to 200%.  Confirm that:          You can see each element and all the text that you could previously      You can use and interact with each element (both with keyboard and mouse)      Confirm that horizontal scrolling is not present except for a few exceptions (i.e. data tables, images, charts, etc.)      To test text resizing:  Within your browser, update your settings to increase text size.          Chrome: Settings &amp;gt; Appearance &amp;gt; Font size      Firefox: Settings &amp;gt; Language &amp;amp; Appearance &amp;gt; Fonts      Edge: Settings &amp;gt; Appearance &amp;gt; Fonts        Confirm that all text on the page resizes appropriately based on the indicated browser size.Contrast and use of colorThe most basic rule in color contrast testing is to confirm that all elements have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against their background. There are some nuances with this requirement where a lower ratio can pass if necessary, however it is always best to aim higher whenever possible.Color use within a page or product should also be evaluated to ensure that it is not the only means of conveying information. This is especially helpful for folks using your product who may be colorblind or have low vision.While testing color does not require any specific testing tools, there are some available that are helpful and may make testing easier:  Contrast finder  WebAIM Contrast Checker  Colorblindly plugin for Chrome  Built-in browser rendering for color blindnessTo test color contrast:  Small text (20px or smaller) has at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio  Large text (greater than 20px) has at least a 3:1 contrast ratio  Non-text elements have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio to their background and to neighboring elements. For example:          Graphics - sections in a pie chart must meet requirements      UI elements - colors indicating if a checkbox or radio button is selected must meet requirements      To test use of color:  Identify all links and confirm that each has an underline.  Identify any data elements (i.e. charts, tables, maps, etc.) and confirm that the information within each is presented with more than just color.          For example, in a table if yes is indicated by coloring a cell green, does it also use another indicator? A checkmark, a pattern, etc.?        Confirm that any instructions given do not refer to color.

There are very few tools that allow you to tell the difference between.The Luxembourg government has several open source accessibility projects inclucing their simplA11yPDFCrawler. This small government has created a great tool which collects and scans PDFs for known accessibility errors. VeraPDF or VeraPDF on GitHub is another open source option that can provide more detailed results but has a more complicated installation.It is possible to create PDF files that meet requirements of Section 508, but it is often overlooked or not done properly. Often the source documents used to create them do not have proper semantics. It is always more expensive to try to remediate a PDF than to implement accessibility best practices into the authoring tool.The UK&#39;s Government Digital Services model decreases the reliance on PDFs and is actively working to move away from them online and pushing for HTML content instead. When publishing a PDF is unavoidable, ideally an HTML or MSWord version of the content should be available as well.For creating accessible documents in Microsoft Word, Excel or Powerpoint, is the preferred method. Microsoft offers an Accessibilty Checker tool, although this may not be an extensive check of the document, it does show major accessibility issues needed to fix.Visit Creating Accessible Documents.Checklist  Check that the PDFs are accessible prior to allowing them to be posted to the website (ideally with a tool like the CommonLook PDF Validator).  Track source files, so that additional improvements can be made, if barriers are identified.  Encourage teams to build documents in HTML first.  Test PDFs with assistive technology.Key questions  Does the department have a clear public policy on use of PDFs?  What is the process to review that all PDF documents are accessible?

Users have always been able to adjust the font size by Pressing the &quot;CTRL and +&quot; and &quot;CTRL and -&quot; keys. Increasingly users are choosing to use dark mode, especially with their phone. Users can also control animation by choosing reduced animation in the operating system.There are widgets that allow users to modify the spacing, font, focusable elements, and even generate a table of contents for your content. There are browser extensions that can force dark mode, eliminate pieces of your page, or read it aloud to you. We are seeing a real explosion of how people of all abilities are engaging with your site, even eye tracking usage is increasing.The BBC had pioneered this with My Web My Way (MWMW), but this has since been archived. UK&#39;s AbilityNet has taken this on and produced My Computer My Way (MCMW), modernizing much of the same content. The BBC now simply maintains an impressive list of accessibility information on their main accessibility page including links to Microsoft, Apple and Google.It is worth adding links to something like MCMW into accessibility statements to help educate users about how to get more power over their devices. Most people do not have anyone help them learn how to make best use of the new technology that is coming built-in with new operating systems. Front-end developers  should also be checking that their sites work with a broader range of users settings.The Inclusive Design Research Centre&#39;s Preferences Framework Editor provides a good example of how many user preferences can be exposed through the user interface. Not only can users choose from a variety of font sizes and color options, but they can also choose between multiple fonts, adjust the spacing, and expose a table of contents from the page&#39;s heading structure.Checklist  Test that your site respects the following CSS media queries:          Dark mode (prefers-color-scheme).

Without a deliberate effort to build a shared understanding and define how digital accessibility is done, the approach and expertise can vary widely. Establishing a community of practice can make it easier to share knowledge and best practices, and help your organization align behind common goals for digital accessibility.Digital accessibility requires technical knowledge, but also personal empathy. Understanding how others experience the digital world is critical for addressing their needs. Therefore, it&#39;s crucial that a community of practice on accessibility involves people with disabilities.As a whole, government bodies need to get better at identifying accessibility barriers, removing them from their systems, and preventing new ones from occurring. This will take a real community effort, and current approaches have not been up to the task. Building a community of people who are working together to identify, resolve and prevent errors will make your organization&#39;s accessibility goals more achievable and sustainable.The BBC is a real leader in this space, building out a Champions Network.

Their lived experience is critical for identifying issues that a test and someone without disabilities may not catch. This can be accomplished by assuring user research in discovery stages includes PwD. Usability testing of specific site features should also include PwD to ensure that the solution works as expected.Out of respect for their time, PwD shouldn&#39;t be engaged to test the accessibility of a website until the results of automated and basic manual tests are implemented.PwD&#39;s lived experience is critical for catching issues and errors that the tests miss, but it is important to not waste people&#39;s time replicating known problems that a computer or a non-disabled person can easily identify. See the playbooks on automated testing and manual testing for more information.When recruiting a testing cohort, it is important to consider the range of disabilities that need to be addressed. Should you test with people who were blind from birth and who use Braille, or those who became blind and use an audio interface? A legally blind person may have some sight, and may use a screen reader in combination with a screen magnifier. If there are audio components, it may be important to include members of the deaf community. People have a range of experiences of perceiving colour, and this can change over time. These are just a few examples.There are many different disabilities and people experiencing combinations of them. Depending on the size of the project you may want to adjust the number of participants who are involved. Most projects simply do not include enough people with disabilities. Remember too that there is variation in how people use Assistive Technology, and so one perspective may not reflect the needs of the whole community. A minimum size would include people with limitations in sight, hearing, mobility and cognition.Many disabilities are invisible, and because of the stigma that can be associated with disability, people may not feel comfortable disclosing this information to their peers. It is statistically likely that a team already includes people with disabilities, but often this is hidden and unknown to the rest of the group.Robust products and services are co-designed with the users. People with disabilities have expertise through lived experience that needs to be recognized, especially when building tools and services for them. &quot;Nothing About Us Without Us!&quot; is a common call in the disability movement, because all too often, people with disabilities are not engaged.

How do you write one and what type of information should be included?What is an accessibility statement?An accessibility statement is a public declaration that highlights the commitment of a company or organization to accessibility and inclusion.Accessibility statements are intended to provide site visitors with information about the accessibility of the website. This information can help people use and navigate the site by setting expectations around site standards and providing details about potential known barriers or technical compatibility.The CivicActions accessibility statement can be found in the footer of our main website.Why provide an accessibility statement?In some cases there is a legal requirement, which is a very compelling reason to have one. For example, all US Federal agencies must maintain an accessibility statement with certain information as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum from December 2023.However, even if there isn&#39;t a legally mandated requirement, providing an accessibility statement on your website shows site visitors that you value accessibility as a  social responsibility and that providing access to information is a priority for your organization.Writing an accessibility statementAt a minimum, the following information should be included in your statement:  A commitment to accessibility  The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standard that the website or product adheres to (e.g. WCAG 2.1 AA)  Any known limitations or existing issues that site visitors should be aware of to help to prevent frustration for the user  Contact information for what to do if/when a user encounters a barrier or issueThe following additional information would also be good to include:  Technical specifications, such as which browser/devices work well and which may have known compatibility issues  Remediation plans for any known or existing accessibility issues  Any links or references to applicable laws and policies  Date the statement was last updatedBased on your particular website/product, there may be additional minimum requirements or some of the additional information mentioned above may be mandatory. For example, US Federal agencies must include (among other things) the date the statement was last updated and also a specific feedback mechanism for reporting issues to the appropriate 508 program office. When drafting your own accessibility statement, it is important to research specific requirements for your region and sector that may impact the information that should be provided.Also, remember that an accessibility statement is for site users, so it is important to write for that audience. Use plain language when writing your statement to allow users to easily understand the information you are telling them.Resources  W3C- Developing an Accessibility Statement  Section508.gov - Developing an Accessibility Statement  Model accessibility statement from GOV.UK"

Even as there are many resources available there is generally a lack of awareness—but when people find these resources they are often quick to take advantage. For example, when the UK&#39;s Government Digital Services (GDS) offered a free course on content design through Future Learn, over 10 thousand people signed up.Some of our favorite, free accessibility courses include:  Web Accessibility by Google;  Digital Accessibility Foundations by the W3C;  Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Accessibility by GeorgiaTech;  Assistive technologies and online learning by the Open University.Podcasts are another great way to learn about web accessibility—including A11yRules.com and Human Potential At Work.

We don&#39;t take this pledge lightly. We know it takes a lot of buy-in and dedication to build a culture of accessibility. It&#39;s not something that a few accessibility experts sprinkled throughout the company can deliver on alone. It takes company-wide effort. The Accessibility Champions program was created to offer CivicActioners a path for increasing leadership and confidence in furthering accessibility initiatives across projects and roles. This community of Accessibility Champions (ACs) are integral to creating and spreading an accessible culture throughout CivicActions.Champions are responsible for fostering awareness and action on digital accessibility within their teams. ACs are a conduit of information from the Accessibility Practice Area to their functional and/or client teams. They also bring concerns, findings, and practices from their functional and/or client teams to the Accessibility Practice Area to share knowledge across teams. Our Champions support their team(s) in building accessibility confidence and by advocating for continual improvement.Objectives of the Accessibility Champions ProgramWe are building a program in which:  Everyone at CivicActions understands the importance of digital accessibility and receives basic training  Teams are equipped to improve the accessibility of the products they build  CivicActions staff are able to improve their skills, knowledge, and leadership in furthering accessible technology  We share what we learn with the wider communityProgram recruitmentAll CivicActioners are encouraged to become Accessibility Champions. Champions come in all sizes and shapes and it is expected that there will be differences in the needs that functional and client teams have. We have ACs on client teams and in functional teams (other practice areas). Teams may decide that they need to have people with more or less experience to lead. Some teams will have only one, but some may have more Champions, particularly if there is mentoring or a distribution of labor involved.Who makes a good Champion?Generally individuals volunteer for this role because they are interested in expanding their accessibility skillset and are passionate about leveling up the accessibility practices of their team. People who are motivating to others, self-directed, self-aware, in tune with team needs, and who have a bias toward action tend to make great Accessibility Champions.Champions typically have interest in…  Learning more about digital accessibility  Research and investigation  Ability to describe barriers in a way that allows them to be reproduced  Coaching and mentoring  Complex problem solving  Presenting to audiences  Relationship building  Conflict resolution  Understanding the systems that create barriers to participation  Learning to use and interpret the results of automated toolsBenefits of becoming a ChampionThe Champions program makes it easier to:  Increase your organizational impact: Many joined CivicActions because they wanted to work for an impact-driven organization. Helping make websites more accessible can have an impact on millions of people.  Advance your career: We also want to support people in their growth within the company. &quot;Accessibility Champion&quot; looks good on your resume. It will help CivicActions become better innovators and win work.  Build cross-functional relationships: The work of accessibility is multidisciplinary and brings you into contact with specialists, leaders, and stakeholders from areas you may not otherwise interact with. These connections improve team communication and can have a lasting impact on your career and exposure to related expertise.Expectations for ChampionsChampions are not expected to be accessibility experts, but they are expected to grow their accessibility knowledge and to support their teams in maturing accessibility practices. Having all of the answers is not required, but a willingness to find answers, foster communication between their client or functional team and the Accessibility Practice Area, and advocate for improved processes and practices is essential.A champion will…  Take responsibility for iteratively making the client&#39;s project more accessible  Recommend process, tooling or other changes to make accessibility a bigger part of the client team&#39;s growth  Work with the Accessibility Practice Area group to surface and codify best practices to share across the company  Surface opportunities for learning and process improvement  Help their functional role have a clear understanding of accessibility expectations for that role  Support team members in meeting accessibility goals including onboarding new membersSpecific examples include:  Raising accessibility issues in team meetings  Auditing projects for areas for improvement  Ensuring there is axe-core testing in our CI/CD process (pa11y with axe, Cypress-axe)  Ensure developers are using an accessibility linter (VSCode, phpStorm, atom)  Ensuring designers include accessibility annotations in wireframes  Working with the project team/PMs to better integrate accessibility into ticketing process  Coordinating actions using shared decision-making and prioritization criteria  Building checklists or default acceptance criteria  Do accessibility code reviews and help coach others on the team  Leading ARRM workshops if useful for new project or addressing backlogsChampion levelsThere is an infinite amount that can be done on accessibility. And yet, we want the program to be a welcoming place for the accessibility-curious to be able to join without the need for advanced study or certifications. Levels provide an on-ramp for staff that may be less experienced with digital accessibility as well as leadership and mentorship opportunities for more experienced staff. The levels are set up to encourage people to push themselves to learn more with time and practice.As champions gain skills, experience, and responsibility they can advance through three levels:Level 1 — Basic knowledgeNo previous accessibility knowledge or experience is necessary for this level, only an enthusiasm to learn. In addition to Accessibility Onboarding for new employees, all CivicActions employees are encouraged to take an Introduction to Web Accessibility course. All employees are welcome to attend the practice area calls and engage in the Slack channel to keep up with best practices and internal accessibility discussions. At this level, the goal is to be able to articulate the importance of accessibility and to identify and prioritize common accessibility issues.Level 2 — ExperiencedThis level is for employees who are able to analyze the accessibility of a task across multiple pages and components and recommend solutions with confidence. Open to employees who have worked toward more in-depth accessibility certification through International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP) Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC), IAAP Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS) or DHS Trusted Tester. Level 2 Champions contribute to the website, write articles, and lead Accessibility Onboarding Workshops for new employees.Level 3 — Taking leadershipLevel 3 is all about impact. At this level, Champions are able to evaluate the accessibility of a product systemically and prioritize approaches which will have the biggest impact. On projects they are expected to track down and advance issues and assist teammates in navigating complex solutions. Internally responsible for the innovation of our Accessibility Practice Area. Level 3 Champions contribute beyond CivicActions by maintaining modules or themes, contributing back to open source, engagement with the W3C Working Groups, and by coaching clients and partners.Resources to start an Accessibility Champions programArticles and talks about beginning and growing Accessibility Champion programs to get you started.

Also known as alt text.Assistive technologiesTechnology designed so people with disabilities have greater functional capabilities with computer-based systems. This could be software or hardware and often benefits a broader range of computer users.Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)A United States civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability.Audio browsersWeb browsers that provide a text-to-speech capability for the blind and visually impaired.Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0A WAI Guide to support authoring interfaces for both ensuring that people with disabilities can use them, and that they support authors in producing more accessible content.BarrierIncludes anything physical, architectural, technological or attitudinal, anything that is based on information or communications or anything that is the result of a policy or a practice that hinders the full and equal participation in society of persons with an impairment, including a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment or a functional limitation.Braille terminalMachines that convert text on a screen to braille by raising bumps through holes on a flat surface.CaptioningThe art of adding captions to a television program or movie.CaptionsA textual representation of sound. This is usually associated with videos, to display real time textual equivalent of speech. Sometimes this moves beyond speech to include other sounds relevant to the video.Content (vs. presentation)The separation of concerns design principle as applied to the authoring and presentation of content. The two should be independent to see that the two are distinct and can be managed independently.Content management system (CMS)CMS is a software application used to oversee the operation of web information. Common CMS applications include software like WordPress and Drupal.ContrastContrast is the perceived difference between two adjacent colours. Two colours from different segments of the colour wheel are contrasting colours. For example, red is from the warm half of the colour wheel and blue is from the cool half.Cascading style sheets (CSS)Styling for HTML.DisabilityA limitation in an ability.DiscoverabilityThe ability of any feature to be found in the context in which it is needed.Document object model (DOM)The Document Object Model is a representation of the structure of a web document. This provides a means for scripts such as JavaScript to manipulate the content and layout of a page.European Harmonized Accessibility Standards (EN 301 549)This is evolving to become the global standard for government policy. This is an evolving standard that roughly follows and extends the WCAG Guidelines.False positivesAn error in data reporting in which a test result improperly indicates the presence of a condition.Graceful degradationWhen a site utilizes new technology and, if disabled, the content maintains effectiveness for the user.Hover state and focus stateIn CSS, a hover state is when the user moves their mouse over an element such as a button or menu item, whereas the focus state is when a user focuses on an element using keyboard controls (the Tab key, typically).Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML5 is the newest version of the language with more options available to create accessible websites.InternationalizationA system whose primary design has been developed to work in multiple languages and in the cultural contexts of different locales.Information Communications Technology (ICT)ICT is an extensional term of the term information technology (IT). It refers to the gambit of technology involved in digital communications.JavaScriptOne of the most widely used scripting languages; JavaScript is a client-side programming language which can be used with almost all user agents.Late adoptersIndividuals who are hesitant to adopt new technology.LocalizationCustomizing or adapting a national or international product for a local market.Language of partsA WCAG Success Criterion for when the language of a text string is not in alignment with the page-wide definition.Luminance contrast ratioA measure of the difference between foreground and background; specific minimal values are recommended via WCAG 2.0.Mark-upA mark-up is what the browser sees. If it is marked up as a link, it can receive focus and take you somewhere else.Modal dialogue boxOften referred to as a &quot;Modal&quot; or &quot;Modal Window&quot;, it is a subordinate graphical interface which opens a child window in the foreground while keeping the parent page visible but inactive.Null alt textNull alt text is including alt text within an &quot;img&quot;, but without any content. An example would be &amp;lt;img alt=&quot; &quot;&amp;gt;. This should only be done for decorative images, spacers and pixels. (resource: An alt Decision Tree)Open sourceOpen Source software is a licensing model of software which gives free access to the source code of the software, allowing interested parties to modify or contribute to the software as they see fit. Commonly created as collaborative projects and shared at no cost.Programmatic focusWhere the computer&#39;s focus is on a web page.Screen readerA software program used to allow reading of content, and navigation of the screen using speech or Braille output. Used primarily by people who have difficulty seeing. JAWS and NVDA are examples for PC desktop users. Apple products come with VoiceOver for both desktop computers and mobile devices, and Android mobile devices come with TalkBack.Search engine optimizationThe process of making a website appear as highly as possible on the list of results returned by a search engine, in order to maximize the volume and quality of website traffic.Section 504Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This act has implications for federal assistance and accommodation in the workplace. If an organization receives federal support of any kind, even if the organization is not a federal or state organization, the organization must comply with Section 504.Section 508Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Until the Section 508 Refresh, this requirement was based on best practices of 1998.Section 508 RefreshThe Refresh brought the guidelines for the USA to be essentially the same as WCAG 2.0 AA.Semantic markupSemantic Markup is the idea of creating more meaning with the information in web pages and web applications. This makes it easier for devices to understand what each aspect of the code means for the end user. HTML5 markup has been optimized to allow developers to create more semantic markup.StyleStyle is what you see visually on a page, implemented with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).TranscriptA text only version of what&#39;s said in a movie or television program; they are not real time and they generally are limited to speech only; they are not a recommended substitute for captions.UsabilityThe principle that information and applications should not only be accessible but also easy to use and understand.User agentThe generic term used to describe any device which might access a webpage.Visual focusWhere the user&#39;s focus is on a Web page. Different browsers&#39; default focus styles may vary, and continue to be altered as browsers change.Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT™)A static document that describes how software, hardware, electronic content, and support documentation meet accessibility requirements. Generally this is aligned with the WCAG standard. VPAT™&#39;s are defined by an industry association, Information Technology Industry Council. VPATs often required in procurement to help buyers understand how accessible a product might be and help to discover deficiencies. These are often more about marketing than reflecting the actual accessibility barriers in the product or service.WCAG 2.* (WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2,1, WCAG 2.2) {#wcag-2-*-wcag-2-0-wcag-2-1-wcag-2-2}The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 is focused on providing an international technical standard for web content. It has 12 guidelines that are organized under four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (ie. POUR). The guidelines each have a testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA.WCAG 3.0The WCAG Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0.WidgetA widget is a small application installed and used on websites. Each widget has a varying amount of purposes. An example of a widget is a small, email newsletter signup form, or a third-party live chat functionality."

        "content"  : "A brief history of digital accessibility.Digital accessibility basicsDigital accessibility is both complicated and simple. It is complicated because there are many layers of technology involved in communicating content from an author to the user. It is simple because, ultimately, if you keep your site simple and follow some basic guidelines, you&#39;re generally going to achieve digital accessibility.Section 508The United States first led the movement to articulate web accessibility with the creation of Section 508 in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In 1998, the U.S. legislature corrected the shortcomings of the original Section 508 Amendment. This included a list of technical standards against which products can be evaluated to determine if they meet the technical compliance.WCAG and POURIn 1999 the World Wide Web Consortium&#39;s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 were published. The guidelines were built to be technology-agnostic—HTML was just one way to structure content on the web—and to accommodate the rapid pace of change online.For example, when the first iPhone was released in 2007, people had no idea how much mobile devices would revolutionize how people interact—both with digital content and each other. The web has continued to evolve rapidly. It is clear that nobody wants to create an app or a website that makes someone physically ill, but how much animation is acceptable? Where is the line between visual changes that help people identify where new content is, and the changes that cause some people to become sick?Additionally, since the WCAG process requires a great deal of negotiation—the standards must be based on evidence-based rules that have broad applicability—it isn&#39;t feasible to make specific guidelines for every disability. There are even occasions where designing a site for one type of disability (say, low vision users) will conflict with another disability (say, people with dyslexia).Rather than guidelines based on specific accommodations for particular disabilities, the W3C&#39;s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) settled on four key principles—known by the acronym POUR—which have guided digital accessibility. To be accessible, digital content must be:  Perceivable: users must be able to perceive the information being presented  Operable: users must be able to operate the interface  Understandable: users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface  Robust: users must be able to access the content as technologies advanceAs the web continues to change and develop, the guidelines to maintain accessibility need to as well. WCAG 2.0 was released in 2008, 2.1 was released in 2018, and 2.2 is slated for release in mid-2021. There may be other releases within the WCAG 2.x series, and the WAI has released the first draft of WCAG 3.0, which is working to revise the whole framework.In the near future, digital tools will be expected to be personalized so that every individual can maximize their use. And while digital accessibility continues to develop, it is clear that government bodies must invest to make their technology more accessible today than before.To be clear, no website will be 100% accessible. Any work that is done should strive for excellence, not perfection. Even a site that met WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance would not necessarily be accessible to everyone. Like security, accessibility is a journey where improvements must be constantly adapted to meet changing realities. Organizations must seek to be better today than they were yesterday.WCAG guidelines should be seen not as the goal to strive for, but a floor from which to build.Other governments around the world began implementing accessibility regulations. In Canada there was the Accessible Canada Act (ACA) and also several provincial acts like Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). Accessibility legislation occurs at all levels of government, and although there may be differences, web standards usually follow the WCAG recommendations.Harmonised European Standard &amp;amp; European Accessibility ActEurope is currently seen as the leader in digital accessibility best practices. The Harmonised European Standard (EN 301 549) is a living document first published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in 2014. The latest version, 3.1.1, was published in November 2019 and embraces WCAG 2.1 AA as the minimum accessibility standard for countries in the EU. Governments in the EU are given the freedom to choose how they want to implement the standard within their own countries, and after the W3C releases WCAG 2.2, it will be reviewed for consideration for an upcoming release of EN 301 549.Web content makes up a lot of the material covered in the standard, but it also includes:  computers, smartphones, tablets and TV sets;  banking ATM and services, and payment terminals;  e-books and e-readers;  mobile apps and ticketing machines.Aligning with EN 301 549 means that government accessibility efforts evolve with an ever-changing internet. Since its creation, EN 301 549 has been embraced by the UK, Mexico and Australia, and will continue to be adopted around the world. There will be costs to adopting the standard, but doing so will make it easier for companies to trade on a global stage.In 2016, the European Union (EU) Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed the EU Web Accessibility Directive. The directive aims to ensure that all Europeans can take a full and active part in the digital economy and society. EU Member states had until 2018 to adapt the Directive into national law.In 2019, the EU formally adopted the European Accessibility Act (EAA) to create a common set of accessibility guidelines for member states. When it comes into effect in 2025, the EAA will apply to businesses as well as governments across the EU—any product or service that is sold for use within the Eurozone will need to comply, including the full range of digital tools. This will include any foreign businesses that work with EU member states.The goal of the EAA is to provide unrestricted access to people experiencing any form of disability and ensure that all EU citizens can access information and services through websites, mobile applications, and electronic devices.European monitoring requirementsBy December 23, 2021, all EU member states will be required to monitor the accessibility of their public-facing websites and report on progress over time. It will be up to member states to determine how this is done, but some of them will certainly leverage open source tools to aggregate national results.In the UK, the Government Digital Services (GDS) is playing the role of the central monitoring team to assess public websites and apps. This monitoring is designed to encourage the public sector to make timely improvements to accessibility. The hope is that with active engagement with various departments, the government can avoid the need to implement further enforcement. The GDS team isn&#39;t sampling all government sites, but is prioritizing those which threaten to exclude the most people, or where there are known or suspected problems. Like others in Europe, the UK has implemented Accessibility Statements into its standard web pages so that citizens are encouraged to submit feedback when they run into barriers. This feedback loop empowers the public and highlights barriers that have been missed by automated and manual testing.In the UK, by the time a website reaches a public beta it must have monitoring in place to identify potential problems. While the monitoring instructions don&#39;t specifically state accessibility, the GDS is actively building tools to make it easier to incorporate, including a site crawler that runs on an open-source accessibility engine built by Deque Systems, called Axe."

When hiring new team members, it&#39;s important to not assume they&#39;re knowledgeable about accessibility. Instead, it&#39;s best to ensure that all team members understand the basics by creating an accessibility onboarding program that every new member participates in.As part of our Accessibility Pledge at CivicActions, we&#39;ve added an introduction to accessibility in our onboarding process. This has helped to advance our accessibility maturity and build a robust culture that has internalized accessibility. We&#39;d like to share our onboarding process here in the hopes that other companies can take inspiration when building their own accessibility onboarding processes.Prepare for an accessibility workshopAll new team members attend a one hour workshop that talks about the basics of accessibility.

We describe different assistive technologies people use, such as auto-captioning, text-to-speech, screen readers, and more.        Accessibility in our organization          We emphasize how CivicActions promotes accessibility with our Accessibility Pledge and how we&#39;re continuously working toward developing products built with a wide range of diversity in mind from the beginning.      We talk about our accessibility practice area and give information about internal meetings and professional development.      We review our Champions program and promote other next steps to learn more about accessibility.        Introduction to accessibility tools          We give a demo on at least one of the browser extensions mentioned above; how to use the tools on different websites, what the results look like and what they mean.      Role-specific workshops (Optional)Each role in a company may need additional support in how they can best do their job. Our team has built role based documentation that can be viewed on our Roles page. For more inspiration, we recommend these websites:  UK&#39;s DWP Guidance for your job role  Digital.gov&#39;s Accessibility for TeamsTake a quizAfter watching videos, reviewing company materials, and attending the accessibility workshop, we encourage new team members to take an accessibility quiz to help gauge their understanding of our training. Our goal is for them to score 80% or higher on this quiz or to reach out to the accessibility team with any questions they may have. To see an example of an accessibility quiz, view the quiz that we&#39;ve created for new team members.CivicActions accessibility quizConclusionAccessibility onboarding is key to ensuring that all team members have a basic understanding of best accessibility practices.

        "content"  : "Plain language helps make your content accessible by allowing your audience to quickly understand it the first time they interact with it. This helps people with different cognitive abilities, people whose first language isn&#39;t English, and those that rely on audio to listen to text.Plain language means that your content is written as clear and simple as possible. Good plain language will help readers find what they need, understand it quickly, and use that information to meet their needs.Basic guidelines for plain language  Use short sentences.          Try to write one idea per sentence.      Avoid repeating words.        Use simple words.          Try to keep the writing below an 8th grade reading level.      Choose words your readers use.      Imagine you&#39;re talking to your reader over the phone. What words would you use to answer questions directly?        Use an active voice.          The subject of a sentence should be performing an action.      For example, &quot;You need to submit the form online.&quot; You, as the subject of the sentence, are performing the action by submitting the form.        Write for your audience.          People visit your website to do something. Before writing, identify the reader&#39;s needs.      How can you answer your reader&#39;s top questions quickly?      What do readers need to know or do after reading your content?        Make it scannable.          Users don&#39;t read, they scan. They often leave web pages within 10 to 20 seconds.      Structure your content with clear headers and present them in a logical order.      Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and lists to sort content into smaller sections that are easier to read.        Don&#39;t use jargon.          Business and technical jargon can be confusing. Try to use common words in place of jargon.      Spell out acronyms the first time one is used.        Don&#39;t use idioms.          Idioms are only clear to people that are in a certain group.      These can be confusing for someone whose first language isn&#39;t English.      Try to use simple words in place of phrases.      Test your contentNow that you&#39;ve written your content, it&#39;s important to test it! This can help you improve your content. You can test your content using readability tools, listening to your content read aloud, and conducting user testing with your audience.Use a readability toolAlways run your content through a readability tool and try to get the reading grade level lower than 8th grade. Some common readability tools are:  Hemingway App: This app highlights content that could be hard for your audience to read.  Readable: This is a paid service that analyzes your content to identify its readability score, grammar errors, and style issues.  Microsoft&#39;s Flesch-Kincaid: This can be used with Microsoft Word to calculate your content&#39;s readability score.Use a text-to-speech readerText-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that takes words on a digital device and reads it aloud. Simply hearing text read aloud can help authors better understand where improvements can be made. We recommend this tool:  Microsoft&#39;s Immersive Reader: In Microsoft Edge, this mode has a Read Aloud tool that can be used to read the text of a web page.User testing with your audienceAutomated readability tools won&#39;t catch everything. You&#39;ll need to test your content with humans too. When user testing, you can:  Use tree testing to discover if menu labels and other content is easy to find. This is a research method where you ask users to look for important resources.  Ask your users to read your content aloud. This can help you identify what words they may struggle with. Users can also rate the clarity of the language.  Ask your users to paraphrase what they read to gauge their understanding.Resources  Federal Plain Language guidelines  Plain Language Association International guidelines  WCAG 2.1 Reading level success criterionNext stepsWhen you are ready to learn more, here are some further guides and resources that may help your content:  Accessible documents  Social media guidelines  Additional tools"

        "url"      : "/guide/semantic-html",
        "content"  : "When a contractor builds a house, they tend to use standard and expected materials that are appropriate for their purpose—i.e. concrete, wood, shingles, etc. Using standard materials helps to ensure the house is built well. If other materials are used instead, the house might require additional work to achieve the same end result. If the Three Little Pigs have taught us anything, unless it&#39;s reinforced, a house made of straw can&#39;t be expected to withstand strong winds.This same principle is true when building a website—there are standard building blocks for each section, typically referred to as semantic HTML tags. Using these tags gives the resulting website more structure and context than building with other, generic tags. Semantic HTML tags also provide some default accessibility to the page elements that would otherwise need to be reinforced using additional, custom code.What is semantic HTML?When someone says that you should be building using semantic HTML, what does this actually mean?Semantic markup refers to the HTML tags that define the meaning and structure of the content they contain. There are many semantic tags but a few common examples are:  &amp;lt;header&amp;gt;: This represents the header or introduction of the website. This is typically the area that contains the site logo and global navigation.  &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;: This is for the main body content of the webpage. There should always be only one main section on each page.  &amp;lt;a&amp;gt;: This tag is sometimes referred to as the anchor element and is used for a link. A link element has an href attribute and goes somewhere, to a new page on the website or an external page on another website.  &amp;lt;button&amp;gt;: This represents a button element. A button element is for an action that does something, such as opening a modal or submitting a form.  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;: This tag represents an item in a list. This tag must be contained within a &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; tag (unordered list) or an &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt; tag (ordered list) or &amp;lt;menu&amp;gt; tag.There are also other, generic tags such as &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;span&amp;gt; that do not define any meaning and therefore are not considered semantic tags.Here&#39;s an example of the same element written with and without semantic tags:Example 1 - Generic tags:&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&amp;gt;About Us&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&amp;gt;Contact&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;Example 2 - Semantic tags:&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&amp;gt;About Us&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&amp;gt;Contact&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;In the first example, using generic tags, without the visual of the website itself, it&#39;s hard to clearly understand what the purpose of this code is for. There are 3 links, grouped together but why exactly it&#39;s not clear.In the second example we clearly see semantic tags for a navigation menu (&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;), containing an unordered list (&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;) with 3 links. There still is no visual but from just the implicit meaning of the tags, it&#39;s understood that the purpose of this code is to provide a navigational list element for the website.Why use semantic HTML?Besides providing clear structure and contextual information to your HTML document, semantic tags will also inherit default styles from the user-agent stylesheets. Each browser, or user-agent, provides a basic set of CSS rules that define how semantic HTML elements will visually render. These rules can include underlining links, a larger font-weight for bold text, backgrounds on buttons, etc. By already having basic styles on certain elements, specifying additional CSS is not always needed which can make your work more efficient.A further benefit of using semantic HTML tags is that along with the default CSS styles, they also provide some basic accessibility functionality, no additional custom code is required,Keyboard functionalityOne of the main benefits of using semantic HTML tags is that by default, they provide the required keyboard functionality needed for accessibility. At a minimum, all interactive elements on a webpage must be available and focusable using the TAB key. They must also respond appropriately to expected keyboard keys. Typically, these keys are ENTER and SPACE, however for certain elements the ARROW keys or ESC key, among others, are expected. Each element has different default behavior and by using the standard semantic tag, you will be getting this default functionality and behavior for free.For example, if an element is created using the &amp;lt;button&amp;gt; tag, a user will be able to tab to the button and will be able to activate it using both the SPACE and ENTER keys. However, another element styled to visually look like a button but created using a generic &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; tag will not have this default keyboard functionality and this interaction will need to be added using additional code, typically JavaScript.ExampleUsing the keyboard, try to tab to the two buttons. Notice that only the first, semantic button receives proper keyboard focus.A semantic buttonGeneric buttonLandmarksPeople using assistive technology often navigate a webpage by using the landmarks on a page. However, these sections need to first be identified as such in order for this to be possible. The 7 sections that should be identified on each page are:  role=&quot;banner&quot;:  Semantic equivalent is &amp;lt;header&amp;gt;  role=&quot;navigation&quot;: Semantic equivalent is &amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;  role=&quot;search&quot;: Semantic equivalent is &amp;lt;search&amp;gt;  role=&quot;main&quot;: Semantic equivalent is &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;  role=&quot;complementary&quot;: Semantic equivalent is &amp;lt;aside&amp;gt;  role=&quot;form&quot;: Semantic equivalent is &amp;lt;form&amp;gt;  role=&quot;contentinfo&quot;: Semantic equivalent is &amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;Structuring web pages using the equivalent semantic tag rather than the role attribute, means these sections will be identified by default, no landmark role will be forgotten, and the user will be able to clearly understand the structure and layout of the page as well as navigate directly to a particular landmark if they choose.Assistive technologyAs with landmarks, assistive technology users, especially those using screen readers, also often use the menus within their software to view a full list of other elements on a page, such as headings, links, buttons or forms. Using that list they can get a sense of the content on the page and can also  jump directly to a particular element if they want.However, only the elements built using semantic HTML tags will be available to these assistive technologies and displayed in these menus. Generic elements, even if they are styled to look like headings, links or buttons, will not be shown in these menus which could cause users to miss important content.Resources  List of semantic elements  Semantic Structure  More information about the div tag  HTML and landmark roles"

Accessible social media content allows people with disabilities to engage with these virtual communities instead of being shut out of the conversation. Taking steps to make your social media content accessible means that more people will be able to engage with it!Basic guidelines for social media  Keep text as clear and simple as possible by using plain language.          Use short sentences and choose words your audience uses.      Don&#39;t use all-caps.      Spell out abbreviations or acronyms.      Include descriptive text before links. For example, &quot;Read the help page for more info: (LINK)&quot;        Add alternative text to all contextual images.          Avoid images with text on them.      Use static images instead of animated GIFs      Make sure images have strong color contrast.        All videos should have captions and transcripts.          Don&#39;t forget to review any auto-generated text.        Be thoughtful about the use of hashtags.          If using hashtags, write them in camel case. This means that each unique word in a hashtag should start with a capital letter. This makes it easier for assistive technology to pronounce hashtags. For example, #WebAccessibility        Limit the use of emoji and special characters.          Use words instead of emojis to describe things.      Add emojis at the end of messages.      Be aware of how screen readers voice emoji and special characters—it can change the meaning of your posts. Special characters can have long spoken names when voiced by a screen reader, burdening some of your users more than others.

This page lists a variety of tools that designers, developers, and others can use to make web content more accessible.Screen readersScreen readers help people who are blind or visually impaired read text on a screen. We recommend using these common screen readers and testing your content with multiple screen readers and devices.  JAWS (Job Access With Speech): This screen reader provides speech and Braille output for Windows. It requires a paid license to run.  NVDA: (Non-Visual Desktop Access): This is another common screen reader for Windows that&#39;s free and doesn&#39;t require a license.  Talkback: A Google screen reader included on Android devices. All Android devices come with this screen reader by default  VoiceOver: While not open source, VoiceOver is a screen reader that&#39;s a default on all Apple devices (desktop and mobile) and gives descriptions in braille.Learn more about screen reader testing.AuthoringAn authoring tool is software that can be used to create or modify content for use by others. These tools should allow authors to create accessible content from the beginning, without having to come up with a workaround. Output should conform to WCAG Level A and Level AA Success Criteria and Conformance Requirements. These are some authoring tools we recommend.  Sa11y: This is an accessibility quality assurance assistant that visually highlights common accessibility and usability issues on a web page.  Editoria11y: This highlights common issues inline within the content editor.  Drupal: This is a content management system and has modules that can enhance its accessibility.Automated testingAutomated accessibility testing should occur at different stages when creating digital content, from design to development. We recommend getting started with these tools and learning more about how to implement automated testing.  Cypress with axe core: This combines the JavaScript testing framework of Cypress with the popular accessibility testing engine, axe core.  Pa11y CI: This is a continuous integration (CI) runner that can test a few pages or an entire site for accessibility issues.BookmarkletsBookmarklets provide quick, automated checks for accessibility issues. They can test for a wide variety of issues, such as testing interactive elements, focus, touch events, and reading order. These are some of the bookmarklets that we recommend, but there are many more out there!  Accessibility and Contrast Bookmarklet: Analyze the contrast of the text on a page and highlight elements which may have readability issues.  ANDI by SSA.gov: A free accessibility testing tool that offers detection of problems, checks for 508 compliance and shows what a screen reader will typically say for interactive elements. It also gives realistic recommendations to improve accessibility.  Reading Order Bookmarklet: Running this bookmarklet will visually number the reading order in which screen-reading software will announce different parts of the page to check to see that it matches the visual order.  W3C markup validator: Checking your HTML for errors catches a lot of accessibility issues, especially with forms and images.Color contrast checkerColor contrast is an important part of accessibility. Text and background colors must have enough contrast so that the content on the page can be easily seen. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 suggest a minimum contrast of 4:5:1. W3C has an Understanding SC 1.4.3 page that explains this in greater detail. These tools can help quickly check if the colors on a page meet these guidelines.  WebAIM contrast checker: Colors can be checked on this webpage, using a bookmarklet, or using their API.  ColorZilla for Chrome or ColorZilla for Firefox: A color picker that can be used in Chrome or Firefox browsers.  Coolors Color Contrast Checker: Check colors on the webpage.Design tool integrationsDifferent design tools can be added to Figma, Sketch, and Storybook to ensure that accessibility criteria is being met. There are plenty of different integrations available, but these are the ones we recommend to start with.Figma  Accessibility Annotation Kit: This kit helps designers document accessibility considerations to share with developers when handing off designs.  Accessibility Checklist for Designers: A checklist that was created on the base of WCAG 2.1 AA standards and helps check designs for accessibility.  Include—Accessibility Annotations: This plugin guides designers through a series of checks and creates multiple annotation layers in an annotations frame.Sketch  Sketch Accessibility Assistant: A linter that checks Sketch elements to make sure they pass AA+ compliance for WCAG 2.1.  Sketch Cluse: Sketch plugin to check and adjust color contrast.Storybook  Storybook-addon-a11y: A Storybook addon which uses axe to improve the accessibility of UI components.  Aria Live: A utility tool for inspecting announcements of ARIA live regionsEPUBAn electronic publication (EPUB) is an e-book file format and is a technical standard set by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). These are some helpful tools that can check for accessibility in this format.  EPUBCheck: The official conformance checker for EPUB publications, maintained by the DAISY Consortium on behalf of W3C  Ace, by DAISY: Assists with the evaluation of accessibility features of EPUB publications and is also maintained by the DAISY Consortium.EvaluationEvaluation tools are software programs or online services that can help determine if your website content meets accessibility guidelines. These are the tools we recommend to help evaluate content at a site or page level.Site level evaluation tools  Domain Accessibility Audit: This web application by MSU College of Natural Science automatically crawls websites and checks for accessibility violations. It&#39;s based on axe by Deque Systems, Inc.  Pa11y: A popular command-line interface which loads web pages and highlights any accessibility issues it finds.Page level evaluation tools  Deque&#39;s axe Browser extension: Test web applications and identify accessibility issues.
