      "content"  : "We spoke to CivicActioner Daniel Mundra, Associate Director of Drupal, aboutthe benefits of Drupal, community contributions, and why working atCivicActions has been so rewarding for him . He is among a team of 60+ Drupalengineers with nearly 20 Acquia certifications and 20+ edX a11y(Accessibility) certifications.CivicActions is known for our Drupal expertise. To you, why is Drupal suchan important tool in the work that we do for our government clients?Drupal is a complex tool but it is the best tool to help deliver complexconcepts for our government clients. Drupal also delivers for our clientswhile still being free, open source, having a growing community, and also notafraid to change/adapt. I don&#39;t believe other similar products could check allthose boxes.I have been working with Drupal for 12+ years, first with Drupal version 6 andnow with 10. Since my early days, Drupal has been a veritable Swiss army knifefor web development. It helped me deliver a lot of value to users in a quickamount of time. Earlier I would produce many sites with a lot of modules butnot consider the maintenance costs, reliability you get with writing tests,giving back to the community, and so on. It left my clients with a functionalsite but a maintenance burden. Nowadays I focus more on contributing back,writing more tests, reducing maintenance burden and thinking of long termsolutions than quicker output of sites. Just like how the Drupal platform andcommunity has evolved, so have I. Drupal has given me the space to do that andI am grateful for that.What are some community contributions to Drupal from your team that you areespecially proud of?CivicActions contributes quite a bit to Drupal. Last year CivicActions wascredited with contributing 90+ contributions and that is only growing. I amparticularly proud of the modules we are adding to the community, like MediaLink Enhancements (from Cameron Prince), Google Programmable Search JSON API(from Timo Zura and Sam Lerner), and recently Content Model Documentation (from Steve Wirt).You are very passionate about accessibility — why is accessibility soimportant to you and how do you work to make projects more accessible atCivicActions?Accessibility is important to me because to truly be human centered we have tomake technology accessible to all. The primary ways I work to make projectsmore accessible is by first building from the beginning with accessibility inmind. The second way is to add layers of accessibility testing to ensure thesite remains accessible. Layers like automated testing, manual testing withkeyboards/screen readers, and testing with disabled users (when possible).Accessibility is a long term commitment and I can say that at CivicActions weare all contributing to that and we are making a difference.What initially drew you to a career in civic tech, particularly atCivicActions?After spending 10 years working in higher education, in particular as an in-house developer for the University of Oregon, I wanted a change. As theuniversity was going away from in-house development, I wanted to continuegrowing my skills while still supporting similar mission-driven organizations.I found both at CivicActions.What is the most rewarding part of your job?Being able to give back to the community and also take part in the companyoutside of the project. I am an associate director now but I wouldn&#39;t havebeen able to reach that role without the support of everyone at CivicActions.They made space for me to take part in company activities like OKRs, guidebookupdates, accessibility practice area, and so on. I am successful because ofthe culture of the team to make space and make most parts of the companyaccessible to discussion, debate and continuous improvement.Any advice for someone looking to follow a similar career trajectory?Ask questions and get involved where you can, either at the company you workfor or in your local community. Find that company and community that energizesyou and bring your whole self to them.On a lighter note, what is a fun fact that people may not know about you?I like statistics so much that for 3 years I was the official statistician forthe Oregon Cricket League. Lots of data entry and review but I was able to seehow local players and teams evolved.Daniel Mundra: Diving into Drupal was originally published inCivicActions on Medium, where people arecontinuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "url"      : "/posts/helping-disabled-veterans-check-in-designing-an-accessibility-map",
      "content"  : "A note on language: We&#39;re using both people-first language (&quot;a person with adisability&quot;) and identity-first language (&quot;disabled person&quot;). We recognizeboth are valid and advocated for within the disability community.&quot;We lost our vision due to our service…my vision gets blurry,&quot; says a Veteranover Zoom during a user research session.We were testing new designs for a web-based app helping Veterans check into amedical appointment.This Veteran&#39;s experience is not uncommon: about 30% of Veterans live with adisability (but that number is likely much higher due to military culture).Almost 7,000 Veterans become newly blind or visually impaired every year. Anddisabilities can vary in type and severity — the most common of which includehearing loss, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), scars, back and neckpain, and migraines. Figure 1: A fewdays before an appointment, a Veteran receives an SMS text with a link tostart pre-check-in. After selecting the link, the Veteran sees the login page(first image). When they complete pre-check-in, they see the submission page(second image). Figure 2: When theVeteran arrives on the day of their appointment, a poster with instructions tocheck-in is placed in the facility. The Veteran scans the QR code or texts&#39;5309&#39; to check into their appointment using their phone. The Medical SupportAssistant (MSA) receives a notification that the Veteran has checked-in totheir appointment. The Veteran waits until called in.Checking into a medical appointment with a smartphone has barriersFor example, it requires a Veteran to:  Own a phone (or have access to one)  See the check-in poster at the facility  Have reasonable tech-savviness to use SMS or a QR code  Understand the steps within a reasonably short time-frame (which can be difficult for some Veterans with cognitive disability or PTSD)  We wanted to design digital and non-digital solutions that helped make itmore usable for disabled Veterans to check into medical appointments.But we had a lot of questions.  Are we able to design for the range of types and severity of disabilities?  Would some solutions only benefit some Veterans, while introducing barriers to others?  How do we decide on those trade-offs?We created an Accessibility Use Case MapAn accessibility use case map is a framework to evaluate proposed solutionsacross multiple different types of disabilities affecting Veterans. Weconsidered both digital and non-digital solutions for each phase of the check-in process.A spreadsheet makes it accessibleAs we note later in the article, we worked with an accessibility specialistwho uses a screen-reader. We chose to design the map in a spreadsheet. Thismade it easy for our colleague to offer feedback. Figure 3: Exampleof accessibility use case map. Solutions are indicated on the x-axis. All ninedisabilities are listed on the y-axis. Each solution is assessed for degree ofimpact: impactful, helpful, it depends, not relevant, and inaccessible. Thiscriteria is discussed later in this article.  We wanted our map to help prioritize solutions that maximized benefits forVeterans living with a variety of disabilities, while minimizing the chancesof introducing barriers.Here&#39;s how we created the accessibility use case map.Step 1: Developed proto-personas for each type of disabilityWe chose nine of the most common types of disabilities reported by Veterans:  Blindness  Low vision  Hard of hearing/deafness  Cognitive disability  PTSD  Motor disabilities  Military Sexual Trauma (MST)  DeafblindnessTime and resources were limited. So we used secondary sources and &quot;bestestimates&quot; to develop light-weight personas of each disability type ( proto-personas).Each described the behavior, symptoms, needs, and tools used to manage thecondition. This allows for quicker, iterative research. Figure 4: Exampleof a proto-persona for a Veteran living with low-vision. We used secondaryresearch sources to validate our assumptions on behaviors, needs andchallenges. Details of the post-it notes are intentionally not-visible, andare shown for example purposes only.Step 2: Created user journey maps to identify pain points and possible solutionsBased on the proto-personas, we created user journey maps across the medicalappointment experience:  Before checking into an appointment  During the appointment, and;  After the appointmentWe proposed solutions to help address pain points across the journey for eachtype of disability. Figure 5: Exampleof user journey map for a Veteran living with low vision and may needcaregiver support to prepare for the medical appointment. Details of the post-it notes are intentionally not-visible, and are shown for example purposesonly.Step 3: Mapped each solution across multiple disability types, creating our accessibility use case mapBut what might benefit someone with one type of disability, might be a barrierfor others. For instance, text-to-speech software is helpful for a blindVeteran trying to access their appointments. But it may be inaccessible to aVeteran who is hard of hearing.Due to this challenge, we decided to map each proposed solution across the 9most common disabilities affecting Veterans.We listed recommendations along the x-axis. We then listed the ninedisabilities along the y-axis.For each type of disability, we assessed if the solution was:  Impactful (positive and we believe will enhance the experience for this disability)  Helpful (positive and it&#39;s not specific to this disability)  It Depends (it may depend on the degree or type of disability, or the recommendation is too complex for us to weigh in at this point)  Not Relevant  Inaccessible (it&#39;s a barrier for a person with this disability)Step 4: Iterated with various accessibility expertsTime constraints didn&#39;t allow us to validate with users (which would&#39;ve beenideal). Instead, we iterated on our map with various accessibilityspecialists:  Josh Kim (Accessibility Designer)  Martha Wilkes ( Accessibility Strategist at the VA Office of the Chief Technology Office)  Melissa Manak (Senior User Experience Mobile Designer)  Angela Fowler (Senior A11Y Specialist and Designer)  Vanessa Luxen (an IAAP certified professional and former Audiologist at CivicActions)Some of the experts we consulted also lived with a disability. This helpedensure we were including the lived experiences of the very people we weredesigning for.Step 5: Developed an &quot;Accessibility Impact Score&quot; for each recommendation.Working with our accessibility experts, we assigned a value depending on howhelpful or unhelpful the solution was for each type of disability. We calledthis our &quot;Accessibility Impact Score.&quot;  3 for Impactful (positive and we believe will enhance the experience for this disability)  2 for Helpful (positive and it is not specific to this disability)  1 for It Depends (it may depend on the degree of type of disability, or the recommendation is too complex for us to weigh in at this point)  0 for Not Relevant  -2 for Inaccessible (it is a barrier for a person with this disability)We then tallied the number of scores for each solution to calculate the final&quot;Accessibility Impact Score.&quot;This helped us assign a numerical value to evaluate the impact eachrecommendation would have across multiple disabilities. For instance,improvements like &quot;sending an SMS notification with a link to pre-check-in&quot;was one of our highest impact solutions. This meant it was impactful for thegreatest number of disabilities.Step 6: Prioritized recommendations based on the Accessibility Impact ScoreUsing a prioritization matrix, we prioritized each recommendation based on itstotal Accessibility Impact Score.We refined it further with our product team based on scope and feasibility, sowe could eventually choose the recommendations we wanted on our roadmap.We took some risks and made many assumptionsThere are many caveats with our framework, for instance:  It favors specific solutions that are impactful for a few disabilities and may end up with a lower score vs. general solutions that help a variety of disabilities.  We did not capture the complexity within each disability type. For example, cognitive disabilities can include a range of disabilities that vary in severity, symptoms and more. We recognize disabilities are not a monolith and the experiences are complex and varied.  It doesn&#39;t take user preferences or familiarity with the technology into account  It&#39;s not intersectional — it doesn&#39;t consider people who live with more than one disability  We didn&#39;t test it with users living with disabilities.  This is our first attempt at designing for disabled Veterans when resourcesare limited, time-frames are tight, and priorities conflict.Ideally, disabled Veterans would be part of our processWhat would we have done differently without those constraints? We would haveincluded disabled Veterans throughout all six steps of the process. This waywe&#39;d design with (not for ) the disabled Veteran community.What&#39;s next?This framework is dynamic. We plan to continue to iterate as we address ourmany assumptions. We hope to start conducting user research sessions withVeterans living with disabilities to validate (and invalidate) our proposedimprovements.Authors: Nira Datta, Senior Content Designer at CivicActions; Ya-ching Tsao,Product Designer at CivicActionsHelping disabled Veterans Check-In: Designing an AccessibilityMap was originally published inCivicActions on Medium, where people arecontinuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

The following tools help us keep the quality of our site high.To achieve the testing we use the following technologies:  remark: A markdown processor (Markdown is how we write all our content that is then compiled into static HTML pages by Jekyll).  retext: A natural language processor to check for issues in the text.  reviewdog: Takes the errors and warnings from remark and retext and comments on the markdown text in the code (pull request) indicating the issues and recommended corrections.  pre-commit: Also test files for any issues and in some cases updates the text automatically.  docker and GitHub Actions: Used to run the reviewdog scripts with remark and retext whenever a pull request is submitted.The setupFor remark/retext we create a Docker image that installs the dependencies and sets up reviewdog to execute our configuration on a pull request. The details are visible in our repository but here are the important bits.The following files (truncated for brevity) configure the plugins for testing markdown and text — and their individual settings.Here are some of our example settings:  Markdown bullets denoted with an asterisk &#39;*&#39;.  Single space between sentences.  Straight quotes (note this down, it will be important later in the post).  Readability set to 18 years.  Checking for spelling mistakes.  Checking for insensitive or inconsiderate language.remarkrc.problem file:{  &quot;settings&quot;: {    &quot;listItemIndent&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,    &quot;bullet&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,    &quot;strong&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,    &quot;emphasis&quot;: &quot;_&quot;,    &quot;fences&quot;: true  },  &quot;plugins&quot;: [      &quot;remark-frontmatter&quot;,      &quot;remark-validate-links&quot;,      &quot;remark-comment-config&quot;,...

The setup is also tuned to only check the changes for the text issues and not all files. This encourages authors to focus on the changes they are submitting.ExamplesIn pull request 373 and the below screenshot you can see that the sentence, &quot;Whole websites can now be easily crawled for bugs&quot; that the word &#39;easily&#39; has been flagged as may be insensitive and we should try to avoid it.In pull request 374 and the below screenshots you can see that I took an earlier version of this post and ran it through the process and got some good feedback.In this screenshot we see a warning about a hard to read sentence.In this screenshot we see that a typo was misattributed as an insensitive word.Automating changesSome of the recommendations that are provided could be automatically edited, like changing smart quotes to straight quotes (remember the note from earlier). We do this using the pre-commit tool and here is an example:In this screenshot we see a warning about a smart quote:In this screenshot the change is made for us and committed to the pull request:You can see the details at this URL: pull request 342.Future considerationsWe are interested in adding the retext-simplify plugin to check phrases for simpler alternatives and maybe reduce the age for readability. Check out the available plugins in the retext documentation.ConclusionFollowing this set-up can help you inject tools to help you test your content. But remember, automation can be devoid of context and can still contain our biases.You should keep tweaking the tools and double-check your content to make sure it meets your values.Further reading and examples  The same tools above are used in:          Quality docs.

      "content"  : "Today is the Global Accessibility Awareness Day or GAAD, and people around the world organize events to raise awareness about digital accessibility. Especially as everything is online these days, GAAD has become something that celebrate throughout the month of May.2020 was the 10th anniversary, and also the launch of the GAAD Foundation.I represented Drupal in Funka&#39;s We4Authors Accessibility Cluster. Yesterday, Funka organized a pre-GAAD event to highlight the importance of authoring tools.The We4Authors Cluster is a multi-CMS (Content Management System) group that is working to better support authors. Authors need to be subject matter experts, not accessibility experts, and CMS tools can help make their job easier. It should be simple for everyone to produce accessible content. For folks familiar with the W3C&#39;s Web Accessibility Initiative, it is essentiallylooking at implementing Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 - Part B. By bringing together leaders in CMS solutions that are popular with governments in the European Union, we are finding solutions which can help many of the authors that will need to implement the European Union&#39;s Web Accessibility Directive.The challenge that governments face to see that their digital solutions are able to meet the needs of all citizens is significant. By working together and funding common solutions to widely used libraries the European Commission is able to make a very cost-effective contribution to improving accessibility. Millions of citizens in member states will benefit from having better accessibility defaults.Both proprietary &amp;amp; open source communities were involved in the We4Authors Cluster and both can help develop common best practices.It was also terrific to see the efforts that the organizers placed on accessibility for this event. A live captionist was engaged for the event. That text was automatically translated into multiple languages so that representatives in non-English speaking countries could participate.Building in accessibility best practices can really help so many people engage with digital content. Everyone can benefit, whether they have a disability or not.",

      "content"  : "On Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we&#39;re excited to be announcing the launch of our initiative to advance accessibility awareness and best practices in government digital services.Photo by PorapakApichodilokfrom PexelsPeople tend to think of disability as a characteristic of a person. But often,the mismatch between design and the person is what causes the disability. Intoday&#39;s tech-driven world, designing and building for people with differentabilities enables more of society to access essential services. It makes for amore inclusive world.Creating accessible websites is a growingpriority within the government.But accessibility goes beyond compliancerequirements. It&#39;s something we canconsider at every step of a service, holistically across government, tobenefit the greatest possible number of people.That&#39;s why we launched the CivicActions Accessibility Practice Area, toestablish a community of learning and growth around accessibility bestpractices. It&#39;s something we all need to work on, from the vendors buildingdigital services to the agencies delivering them to the public. And this workis never &quot;done&quot; — we know there is always more to do, and we invite everyoneto do it with us.Building a foundation for accessibility best practicesWe&#39;re working on embedding accessibility into our offerings by:  Developing a proactive, interactive process to make government services accessible to everyone, called the Holistic Enterprise Accessibility Review Technique (HEART)  Incorporating accessibility into our human-centered design process at CivicActions, ensuring that our design practices integrate accessibility into our client work  Building accessibility personas to drive our design thinking, and building our &#39;designer&#39;s accessibility toolkit&#39; with templates to guide each phase of the decision making process  Exploring how we might incorporate plain language service training  Creating recommendations on how to structure project teams to include accessibility from the start  Integrating accessibility into our processes and workflows, including company materials like our handbook, contracts, and proposalsPhoto by JuditaTamošiūnaitėfrom PexelsWe&#39;re passionate about fixing problems &quot;at the source&quot;, which has led us tofocus on improving legacy procurement — right where many accessibilityproblems begin. We&#39;re currently developing an open, machine-readable templateto help organizations show how well their product meets accessibilitystandards. It&#39;s our version of the current standard, known as VoluntaryProduct Accessibility Template (VPAT). We hopeit will provide a better alternative for agencies looking to accurately gaugethe accessibility of the products they are considering.Creating a community hub for accessibilityTo help build enthusiasm and education around accessibility, we developed anopen source website with resourcesand best practices. It serves as a digital hub for our growing community.We&#39;re already seeing a growing interest in the conversation on improving theaccessibility of government services. We&#39;ve presented at the General ServicesAdministration (GSA) Accessibility Guild and the GSA has incorporated ourautomated testing solution on their website.We&#39;re also talking about:  Why we need accessibility compliance as code  How to integrate accessibility early and throughout your process  Why anchor links are a must for government agencies  How to run automated testing on your GitHub-hosted Jekyll site  Why open-source collaboration is key to busting silosWe&#39;re using and building on a range of government accessibility sourcesincluding the United States Web Design System (USWDS), 18F, and the UK&#39;sGovernment Digital Services. We&#39;re beginning to influence the conversation too(our automated testing solution is now part of 18F&#39;splaybook). This justshows how we can all work together to build a stronger global community ofdigital services professionals who all want to make a more accessible world.Building capacity in our own organizationIt can be difficult informing busy professionals about accessibility. To adoptnew ways of thinking and working as an organization, you have to embedaccessibility as part of the culture. So our community of practice also servesas an internal accessibility support team. We want to make it easier for ourcolleagues to grow their knowledge and expertise. To drive internal education,we:  Maintain an accessibility playbook and guide with a focus on open source solutions serving government  Promote and educate about solutions that are relevant, scalable, and reliable  Treat accessibility questions within the organization like a customer support ticket, making it easy for our colleagues to ask questions and get help  Run an accessibility study group within the organization to develop professional skills in accessibility (and work towards certification)  Host a Slack channel to discuss current events and articles on accessibilityThecommunity of practice helps us build a culture of accessibility in our ownorganization and beyond.Collectively, this helps us build accessibility confidence within theorganization, so CivicActioners can more readily apply it to projects.Measuring successThere are plenty of metrics to measure how we&#39;re advancing our mission. As weramp up, we are strategically choosing to measure our success through:  Impact through our new accessibility site, which is emerging as a useful resource and establishing credibility  Growth of accessibility as a service that we provide to the government, as evidenced by the number of submissions on our contact form and traffic to the accessibility service pages (which we&#39;ll be publishing soon!)  Expansion of our practice area, specifically by the number of members and engagements in weekly meetings  Increase of feedback on our accessibility statement, which helps us understand how we can better meet the needs of our visitors.Some folks in theCivicActions Accessibility community of practice.How we workNobody has all the answers. That&#39;s why we work in the open. We believe this isthe best way to improve our practices.

He&#39;s passionate about changingthe conversation around accessibility in civic tech by moving beyondcompliance to view these needs for what they are: a humanright.Senior Strategist Mike Gifford in his natural habitatThe world of civic tech is deep and wide. Why accessibility? What approachshould we be taking as we attempt to learn about issues within theaccessibility community?Photo of Alan and Mike, courtesy of Mike&#39;sFlickrMike: For me, it started with ** empathy and friendship. Alan Shain,who&#39;s been a roommate and friend since 1990, has cerebral palsy. He&#39;s a formerbureaucrat and a comic who has been active in the Canadian arts community.He&#39;s taught me the importance of the disability rights movement. Knowing himgot me thinking more about humanity and the abilities we possess, and thenotion that we are all only &quot;temporarily able-bodied.&quot; We have some abilitiesright now, but that may change drastically tomorrow. As we grow older, thingsinevitably happen to our bodies. Yet, we have a big aversion to the idea ofour own mortality, so we often overlook that.  &quot;We are all only temporarily able-bodied — we have some abilities rightnow, but that may change drastically tomorrow.&quot;Through many conversations with Alan, I&#39;ve become more appreciative of howother people move through this world. There&#39;s much more to accessibility thanpeople realize. It helps to open our minds and consider that there aretemporary and situational disabilities, such as ones caused by medications, oreven by losing your glasses. You could have trouble doing your taxes becauseyou have to care for your children, or because you&#39;re simply struggling tojuggle more than one thing at a time. You could be trying to access a websitewith low contrast while outside on a sunny day. These are all examples ofaccessibility issues.  &quot;There are temporary disabilities and situational ones, such as onescaused by medications, or even by losing your glasses.&quot;PerfectoCapucineon UnsplashWhen you think about web accessibility, what are some common misconceptionsor mistakes you see? How can they be addressed?A lot of people assume things are accessible, when in fact they are not. TakeDrupal&#39;s website, for example. People assume that Drupal.org is accessible,and therefore, no other work needs to be done. While Drupal has some built-inaccessibility features, there are other issues that aren&#39;t coming to light.I would love to have people adopt the mindset that accessibility featuresshould be included from the start, and not as an afterthought. Wanting to bemore accessible today than yesterday should always be the goal. This meansbuilding frameworks that pave the way for inclusive, forward-thinkingpractices. We&#39;re dealing with something that changes all the time, so it&#39;sabout more than just performance. We need to be constantly finding ways ofbringing more people into the conversation; we&#39;re excluding far too manypeople.  &quot;I would love to have people adopt the mindset that accessibility featuresshould be included from the start, and not as an afterthought.&quot;What changes have you seen over time in this industry?The number of educational resources addressing accessibility issues hasincreased significantly. And they are much more timely and interesting than adecade ago, when the conversation first shifted towards these issues.For example, tools like axe accessibilitytesting provide more opportunities to uncoverproblematic issues on websites. It would be great if we could monitor thoseinstances even more. In Europe the government is tasked with monitoring theaccess of all public websites. The results have to be published, which holdsthem accountable to the standards they set, and increases the transparency ofexisting issues. If a department scores low on accessibility compliance,people will know, and expect a response. It&#39;s like checkers! The good thing isthat there are standard automated tools that can trawl websites and show whereimprovements can be made.AndyFeliciottion UnsplashWhere do you see web accessibility going in the future? Do you have any&quot;big bets&quot; when it comes to emerging technologies or trends?I think ** VR and augmented reality will have a big impact soon. We&#39;re atthe edge of them being more meaningfully included in our lives. It would begreat for engagement — an interactive way to start thinking about how to makeemerging technologies more accessible. Computers are built into so manydevices, but they still contain significant impairments. Washing machines andother appliances could be adapted to be more intuitive, too.For people reading this, how can they be part of the solution?Ask questions and explore what&#39;s out there. Educate yourself, and spend timetrying to understand how other people interact with the web and how importantthat access is to all of us. Look into features like the Wave toolbar andaccessibility insights from Microsoft to get a sense of accessibility issuesthat others face. These tools are great for evaluating and aiding in awarenessof the existing problems, and are structured to give users a visual cue ofwhere they might be.Also, try to make the conversation about accessibility personal. Ask peopleabout the needs their parents might have as they age. What general challengeswill they face? For example, when you&#39;re younger, it&#39;s easier for you tomemorize things. but that changes as we age. Show people how we face similarchallenges at different points in our lives, and normalize addressing thoseconcerns now rather than later. That said, there are one in five peoplesuffering from permanent disabilities, so the probability of you knowingsomeone with one is very high.  &quot;Try to make the conversation about accessibility personal.&quot;Why should the government prioritize web accessibility in procurement?Government is the largest single purchaser of goods and services, so as anentity, it has a huge impact on setting accessibility standards for everyoneelse. If the government commits to only buying accessible tech, it will changethe world. Currently though, the federal government often favors certaincorporations, or software or tools that have barriers to accessibility.  &quot;If the government commits to only buying accessible tech, it will changethe world.&quot;ThisisEngineeringRAEngon UnsplashDo you see open source software as a way to improve accessibility atscale?Yes, using open source tools can actually be part of an accessibilitystrategy for a government organization.For example, Drupal issues can affect a million websites that use it, butbecause it is open source, fixing issues in the Drupal core fixes themeverywhere — the scalability is huge. With proprietary software, you&#39;ll haveto cobble together your best hope of an answer to any issues that arise. Youmay not be able to share information outside of a silo because of bureaucraticor intellectual property issues with the software you are being forced to use.  &quot;Open source tools can actually be part of an accessibility strategy for agovernment organization.&quot;It&#39;s more efficient to work in open source because when we get it right, itscales. The cost to the taxpayer for methods using proprietary software isunsustainable; there&#39;s no way to share the wisdom. Everyone is struggling tofind the same solutions to problems, and they end up cobbling somethingtogether instead of working effectively. Open source tech allows you toexplore all your options and get the best answer to a problem, because youhave a whole community supporting it. If you have questions about something,and the community answers them for you, it&#39;s being answered for everyone else,too.Learn more  Mike Gifford at DrupalCon Global 2020  Challenges in automating accessibility  Writing impactful accessibility reports  Accessibility initiatives from the White House  How open source tools improve accessibility for governmentConnect with Mike  LinkedIn  GitHub  Medium  TwitterQ&amp;amp;A with Mike Gifford: Accessibility in civictech was originally published inCivicActions on Medium, where people arecontinuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

The site is hosted through GitHub Pages.We added automated accessibility testing using GitHub Actions and pa11y-ci with axe.Configuring Jekyll with a sitemap and npmWe recommend adding a sitemap.xml generator to Jekyll which will be used by pa11y-ci to test all pages. We use the jekyll-sitemap plugin.We recommend using npm to manage the pa11y-ci packages and commands.

      "content"  : "Praise and recommendations for the accessibility statement published by the new administrationWith the inauguration on January 20, the WhiteHouse.gov team released a newwebsite. A noticeable and well received feature of the new site is that itonce again has an accessibilitystatement which is linked in thefooter of every page — a best practice that demonstrates this administration&#39;scommitment to serving all Americans of all abilities.The short-but-aspirational statement makes it clear that this is just thebeginning, and that the White House team will continue working to build a sitethat is accessible and usable by folks who are challenged by impairments,using assistive devices, or facing situational barriers that make it harder tonavigate online.  The statement serves as an initial step toward making the website, and allservices, accessible to the greatest number of people possible.The statement serves as an initial step toward making the website, and allservices, accessible to the greatest number of people possible. It&#39;s clearthat this administration isn&#39;t just aiming for compliance with the currentrequirements of the recently-refreshed Section 508guidelines, but going the full extent to align with WCAG 2.1AA — the latest W3Crecommendation and the standard beginning to be adopted by governmentsworldwide.An even better statement: suggestions for improvementWhile the newly released accessibility statement is a laudable first step,it&#39;s understood to be a work-in-progress. Everyone working on digital productsand projects for public services should be continually looking foropportunities to make them more accessible, and the White House statementspecifically invites comments on ways to improve. Our recommendations include:Make it easy to get in touchTo make it easier for people to flag problems with the site or give feedback,more ways to get in touch could be offered. There are currently several phonenumbers listed (including some for hearing impaired folks — well done!), but aweb form, email address, or even Twitter account could be added to allow usersto digitally submit ways to improve the site. After all, some people are non-verbal, and others might feel a bit shy about picking up the phone and callingthe White House!Additionally, digital feedback options can capture browser and operatingsystem information and allow people to upload screenshots, which makesdebugging easier. Email and Twitter can be used to gather information into acommon issue queue to manage feedback and make sure that issues are identifiedand fixed in a timely manner.Address the whole White House experienceThe accessibility statement could be expanded to provide users withinformation about the accessibility features of the White House itself, notjust the website. For example, when we are able to do White House tours again,where will visitors go to find out if there is an accessible washroom? Theremay also be mobile apps that fall under the White House management that needto be covered in accessibility considerations. Thinking about all aspects ofservices (digital and physical) can help agencies provide the most holisticaccessible experience to everyone.  Thinking about all aspects of services (digital and physical) can helpagencies provide the most holistic accessible experience to everyone.Account for accessibility limitationsRecognizing that accessibility is a journey that never ends, it&#39;s important toacknowledge where there are limitations that impaired people may encounterbreakdowns in accessibility. For example, if users navigate to archivedpages of the website, they will likely find them less accessible than thecurrent pages that are being brought up to an improved standard.Legacy files and videos may also be found lacking in accessibility. Ifthere is published content that isn&#39;t accessible but is still being served upto people, the statement can identify it, and explain if there is a processfor requesting that the material be provided in an accessible format.  Recognizing that accessibility is a journey that never ends, it&#39;s importantto acknowledge where there are limitations that impaired people mayencounter breakdowns in accessibility.And of course there is the challenge of the ever-beloved-by-government PDFfiles. Will the WhiteHouse.gov team be continuing to use PDF files, orfollowing the model that the UK hasrecommended? If PDFs will be used, is there a plan formaking them accessible, or providing the information in an additional formatthat is accessible? Will large print versions be made available, or only onrequest? These are all questions that can be addressed in a robustaccessibility statement.Show how the sausage is madeAccessibility and transparency are closely linked. There is an opportunityhere to provide visibility into how WhiteHouse.gov is built, which can promotebetter understanding and usability for everyone. The White House could explainthat the site is built with WordPress and that they are following theaccessibility best practicesdefined in the WordPress community. This includes using a plug-in that allowsusers to switch between high/low contrast, as well as change the font size.Many people still don&#39;t know about darkmode, or how they can configure it by default in theirbrowser.If the site is built on the United States Web DesignSystem (USWDS), it would be useful tohighlight this. This is a U.S. Government framework that has been extensivelytested for accessibility best practices. It may be worth noting that the WhiteHouse is committed to keeping up with the USWDS and will be applying updatesto this framework to keep up-to-date with security/accessibility bestpractices. If there are deviations from the standard implementation, thiscould be explained.It would be also important to know what is the testing process used internallyin the WhiteHouse.gov team. Are automated tools used? Are new features testedwith people who have lived experience with disability? Does the team test forkeyboard-only users? Has anyone checked what happens to text if someone zoomsin their browser to enlarge 300%? Explaining the extent of testing that hasbeen done will allow people to predict what level of accessibility they mayfind for their own particular needs when using WhiteHouse.gov.Accessibility statement best practicesFor the White House team, and for all of us working to create digital servicesthat are usable by the greatest number of people, there are guidelines tohelp. If any team is looking to start with a robust accessibility statement,they may start with the advice of accessibility expert Denis Boudreau, whosummarized the four essential elements of an accessibilitystatement. Itshould have:  Statement of intention to best serve people with disabilities  Reference to the standards followed (usually WCAG 2.0 AA)  Examples of accessible implementations on their site  How to reach out with comments or requests for helpAccessibility expert Karl Groves outlined alist that adds: &quot;What are you doing tosupport and improve accessibility?&quot; as an important element. Lainey Feingold,a well respected legal accessibility expert, has suggested that an idealaccessibility statement would also includereferences to an organization&#39;s accessibility policies and include informationabout other accessibility services. Web accessibility firm Microassistdeveloped a useful checklist for gettingstarted.The W3C has an accessibility statementgenerator whichadds in section for technical information that might help a user betternavigate the site. Disability:IN and the UK&#39;s Government DigitalService have also produced some excellent guides. The accessibilitystatement page, perhaps more than any other page, should be kept current sopeople can access accurate information — and of course it should be made asaccessible as possible!A website for all peopleIt is encouraging to see what the new administration has done to emphasize theimportance of accessibility, even in the first weeks after the inauguration.There is a real commitment from the Biden team to meet the needs of allpeople, clearly including the 20% that have disabilities. The web team behindthe White House site — like all of us who are working in support of governmentdigital services — have a significant challenge ahead, but an equallysignificant obligation to do the hard work and always be improving.

      "content"  : "How agencies can adopt an open source strategy to make their services more usable by people of all abilitiesPhoto by TimMossholderon UnsplashGovernment agencies, of all organizations, have perhaps the greatestobligation to plan for the accessibility of theirwebsites anddigital services. Beyond meeting compliance requirements for accessibility,mission-focused agencies want to make sure the greatestnumber of people — regardless of ability — can use and understand theimportant content and services provided online.There&#39;s a tendency to think only of permanently &quot;disabled&quot; people when we talkabout accessibility, but it&#39;s an issue that extends to a large portion of thepopulation. Temporary and situational disabilities can affect all of us fromtime-to time — as we find ourselves with an injured hand or out on a sunny daytrying to read our phones. And of course, some of the people that most needgovernment services may also face some of the greatest barriers in accessingdigital content — such as English Language Learner immigrants, low-incomefamilies with limited access to Internet devices, the aging populationreceiving Medicare, or Veterans struggling with mental health challenges.Meeting the needs of people with varying abilities and backgrounds is a multi-layered issue requiring conscious decisions around technology and process inorder to get it right. This means government digital platforms should be builtwith accessibility in mind, using modern tools and practices that willconstantly improve instead of falling out of date.  Meeting the needs of people with varying abilities and backgrounds is amulti-layered issue requiring conscious decisions around technology andprocess.CivicActions has long been a proponent of open sourcetechnologies and agilepractices, which provide many benefits to government agencies, including anaccessibility advantage. Here are four recommendations for an open sourcestrategy that will set agencies up for success in the goal of providing modernand accessible digital services.Use tools that are ready-made for accessibilityIt only makes sense to start on the right foot by using tools that havealready been tested for accessibility — otherwise you are beginning with a lotof technical debt. Your team will be responsible for finding and fixing allthe errors, and continually monitoring anything that&#39;s built to make sure thesystems continue to be functional for groups that depend on you foraccessibility (e.g., people who use assistive technologies like screenreaders).Open source platforms such as Drupal (for websitecontent management) and the U.S. Web DesignStandards (USWDS) (for designinggovernment websites) are already evaluated against the newly updated Section508 requirements and have been extensively tested against the World WideWeb Consortium&#39;s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0AA. The combination ofthese tools for government websites provides an accessibility boost from theget-go. Accessibility is a complicated issue, so using platforms that arecontinually maintained by the open source community is smarter than trying toapply &quot;quick fixes&quot; to problems as they are discovered — which can put yourorganization at risk.  Open source platforms like Drupal and USWDS are built to meet accessibilitystandards as they evolve.CivicActions engineers and designers have been working on the pairing ofDrupal and USWDS since the design standards were initially released, knowingthese open source tools would be a powerful combination for agencies lookingto bring their systems up to date. From presenting about the benefits of thispairing when building government sites, toco-maintaining a USWDS base theme inDrupal, we&#39;re committed to helping agencies make the most of these platformsin their modernization efforts.Choose an agile approachWhether you&#39;re modernizing a legacy system, building something new, orimproving current operations, an agile approach is best for keepingaccessibility at the forefront. This is our go-to process for any work withgovernment clients, because the iterative cycles allow barriers to beidentified and resolved early in the process — saving time and money in theend. Agile also pairs well with an open source strategy, because open sourcetools evolve constantly as improvements are made by people who are using them.With all team members working in an agile manner:  Designers can quickly identify potential accessibility problems in their prototypes  Content authors can check for readability (and compatibility with assistive technology)  Developers can use automated accessibility tools to catch issues before code is committed to the repositoryAnd this can all happen before clients even see prototypes, let alone beforehuge systems are put in place that would be time-consuming and expensive tofix if accessibility issues were uncovered later. Our years of experience withopen source tools (especially Drupal) have shown that agile allows forcomprehensive testing at every stage of a project in addition to theopportunity to benefit from work that others have done — which improves theoverall accessibility, security, and usability of technology systems.Plan for the futureThe web is evolving quickly. Browsers, standards, and use-cases change overtime. And agencies will increasingly see people accessing their websites andservices through new technologies that depend on semanticcontent inorder to work well — which adds plenty of layers to the accessibilitychallenge.For example, Google search results glean information about organizations fromstructured site content. The use of assistant technologies like Siri, Alexa,and Google Home will make voice recognition a growing interface to considerfrom an accessibility perspective. And Virtual / Augmented Reality willcontinue to grow in popularity, meaning that government sites will need to beaccessible not just through home browsers, but through mobile devices, cardashboards, home speakers, and other AI.All this means that no &quot;accessibility checklist&quot; will ensure your site meetsits accessibility requirements next year, or in five years. So it&#39;s importantto view accessibility as a journey, not a destination. Agencies should planfor the future by establishing a strong foundation that will allow them toevolve their accessibility efforts for years to come — without having to scrapold technologies and start over!  Accessibility is a journey, not a destination.One way to do this is through open source tools like Drupal and USWDS, whichare constantly improved as maintainers and organizations contribute updatesand fixes. As technology evolves, these tools keep up, making it easier tomaintain accessibility over time. That&#39;s part of the reason Drupal is trustedby leading disability organizations like the National Federation of the Blind.For government, as well, Drupal provides a platform for managing web contentthat is built for accessibility and will continue to evolve along with theonline behavior of constituents.Be part of the communityCommunity contributions are the driving force that make open source tools soadaptable. Unlike proprietary software that is owned and maintained by oneentity, open source tools are owned by everyone and can be improved by anyone.More government organizations are adopting this open approach to technology asa way to share helpful code with other agencies and the public — while also gaining a communityof support upstream as open source software libraries are continually updated.Particularly with Drupal and USWDS, which are heavily used by government,accessibility improvements are made whenever barriers to users are identified.This makes it easier for all agencies using these tools to implementaccessibility best practices for their web content.  Open source tools like Drupal and USWDS make it easier for agencies toimplement accessibility best practices.CivicActions has cultivated and contributed to open source communities forover a decade. Their teams are actively using and improving Drupal and theU.S. Web Design System, working with agencies to make government services moreaccessible to everyone. Being part of these communities allows developers anddesigners to stay familiar with issue queues, create and test patches, andlearn from others who are using the same systems in different ways — so we canall shape these tools to be as functional, flexible, and useful as possible.As governments seek to make accessibility a priority in today&#39;s digital world,it makes sense to start with tools that are purpose-built to evolve along withtechnology systems and to be part of communities that care deeply aboutmeeting the needs of all users. Open source tools like Drupal and the U.S. WebDesign System can help you stay compliant with accessibility regulations, butalso to lay a strong foundation for a future in which people of all abilitiescan more easily benefit from the services you provide.CivicActions delights in helping agencies adapt these tools to betterfulfill their missions.

We&#39;ve outlined our approach and learn about the broad range of services we offer at [CivicActions our central website](https://civicactions.com/approach). CivicActions has deep experience with open source software and agile development - both lend themselves to great accessibility practices. Our goals are audatious, but we have a talented team and aren&#39;t working in isolation. Because we are actively invovled in open communities, we are able to draw on and contribute to a vibrant, evolving ecosystem. This is necessary, if we are going to ensure that we are able to support our clients in building digital content that is more accessible today than it was yesterday. ## Basic servicesWe do offer training, technical reviews and monitoring services. We have considerable experience with remediating sites built on open source technology like Drupal. Collectively our team has over 500 years of experience with the Drupal community. Our team has played a key role in seeing that this Content Management System (CMS) is a leader in accessibility. We&#39;re involved in many other open source projects, and have have extensive experience leveraging open source communities to help our clients accomplish their needs. For any organization seeking to implement consistent, secure, user friendly and accessible experiences, open source provides unparralled flexibility. Very few organizations have our level of experience in maximizing usage of open source approaches to problem solving. We can help your software development teams bring accessibility into every sprint so that accessibility solutions are cheaper and more robust. By building accessibility into our process we can ensure that there aren&#39;t compliance surprises at the end of the project. ## Holistic approachesWe like to begin all of our accessibility work with an extensive discovery process that allows us to get a high-level perspective of the organization&#39;s accessibility maturity. This systems approach to accessibility includes user research and policy/practice evaluation so we can help your team identify the barriers in your site today, as well as to avoid the ones that otherwise would be introduced tomorrow. Borrowing from the best practices of Service Design, we know that giving people the right incentives and examples, is as important as having good tools and templates. Our team has a unique methodology to bring our deep technical understanding to build organization-wide strategies to embrace accessibility. The technical challenges of accessibility will only be addressed when we have accessibility confident organizations.

Because of the nature of vision related disabilities there is considerable variation even within the blind and low vision community.Job Access With Speech (JAWS) is a common screen reader tool that enables people with visual impairments to read digital content, either by text-to-speech or Braille display. However, JAWS is not free. Use of Microsoft&#39;s Narrator is increasing, but still trails behind other screen readers. Few governments are using NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA), even though it is a free, open source solution that is nearly as popular with the blind community. All Apple products come with VoiceOver which is another powerful screen reader. Android comes with the open source TalkBack screen reader.There are a range of other assistive technologies which are available to support other disabilities. We often overlook voice control, with tools like Dragon Naturally Speaking, Windows Speech and Apple&#39;s Voice Control. There is a range of disabilities where motion for the user is severely limited and where simple switches need to be employed to navigate the website. Probably the most famous switch user was Stephen Hawking used a handheld switch early in his life, but then moved to a cheek switch when he lost control of his hands.Whatever software you choose, it is always good practice to support the latest two major releases of assistive technology to allow for late adopters, and to test with actual blind users. It takes considerable effort for a sighted user to learn to use a screen reader how a blind user does., and simply being able to use one of these assistive technology tools may not be the best way to evaluate if a page is accessible.Checklist  Ensure your team has access to a desktop screen reader in Windows and Apple as well as a mobile one.  Test navigating the website with voice control (speech to text).  Ensure that you have access to the latest version of the assistive technology.Key questions  Does your team have the deep knowledge that is required to understand how a blind user actually understands the page?  Is user testing done with people who are completely blind, partially sighted, and who become blind as adults? Screen reader users have a lot of flexibility."

There are many applications which are proving useful for people who are blind, low vision or those who are color blind. There are ways that it could be used to support people with all forms of disability.On the other hand, there are a lot of AI projects which are making bold claims which exaggerate what they can actually do, and where it is possible to actually hurt people with disabilities. A popular example is the AccessiBe widget that boldly claims to use AI to make your website WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, while failing to do so. AI Image recognition for alt text is another example, where people are hoping to simply replace the human effort of writing a meaningful alt text.Jutta Treviranus has pioneered many important inclusion initiatives, and her work on AI is no exception. The edge cases are always going to be at a higher risk of being misunderstood while using machine learning. We need to shift our design approaches from merely satisfying 80% of the users, to build for the fringe. As with other minorities groups, people with disabilities are often disadvantaged with biased data.We can use machine learning to support accessibility, but in many cases it is better to approach it from the approach of Intelligence Augmented (IA). How do we use AI to support authors to produce better content. Perhaps it is by suggesting alt text for the author to review and modify (if needed). AI can also look for patterns in larger datasets than people can process to look for errors that a human would find difficult to pick out.Key questions  What algorithms are you using in your organization?

        "url"      : "/playbook/authoring",
        "content"  : "Many of the accessibility errors on the web are accidentally produced by unsuspecting content editors. With the right processes and tools in place, we can make it easier to produce accessible content—and harder to publish inaccessible content.To start to address this issue, the EU recently commissioned Funka—a Swedish accessibility firm—to conduct a pilot called We4Authors on web authoring tools, producers and communities. The pilot evaluated several different Content Management Systems (CMS), including Drupal, to find ways to increase accessible publishing practices. What became clear, is that CMSs are currently contributing more to the problem than most are aware, by overlooking providing authors with support they need to produce accessible content. Many errors are a result of author inputs in the WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE, CKEditor, etc), and most web authors are not accessibility experts and so do not know the best practices to publish accessible content in their CMS. Most authors are not accessibility experts, and few have the time to go through the additional steps necessary to create accessible content.We4Authors demonstrates that many content producers and suppliers claim to deliver accessible content, many just don&#39;t understand accessibility. To make matters worse, CMSs are often not built from the author&#39;s perspective, which makes it hard to create accessible content and forces authors to navigate unintuitive publishing interfaces. Having a pleasant authoring experience isn&#39;t just a perk—it can greatly facilitate the production of accessible content—but unfortunately it&#39;s usually overlooked.The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0—a W3C Recommendation in 2015—is the most comprehensive approach to address the accessibility of authoring tools. Part A of the guidelines addresses the authoring interface to ensure that it too meets WCAG requirements, and Part B aligns directly with the goal of supporting authors in producing accessible content.Drupal 8 has worked to achieve many elements of both parts for ATAG 2.0 AA. More than any other popular CMS, Drupal&#39;s authoring environment is well-positioned to support authors with disabilities. Drupal has also implemented many measures to update the authoring experience and ensure more inclusive patterns are available to authors by default.ATAG 2.0 Part B identifies where a CMS can help authors create more accessible content. This doesn&#39;t remove the need for training, but should make it easier for people to implement best practices consistently. Government employees can&#39;t all be expected to be accessibility experts, but we can and must provide them with the right tools for creating accessible content.Checklist  Work to see that the authoring interface is accessible.  Feature ATAG 2.0 requirements as part of new technology procurement.  Simplify the authoring interface to make it easier for authors to make accessible content.  Include links to accessibility guidelines in help text where appropriate.Key questions  Are alt texts required? Can this be over-ridden for decorative images?  Are heading tags used semantically to describe the structure of the content?  Are authors given help on how to create accessible content (ie. how to write good alt text)?"

        "content"  : "OverviewAutomated testing can occur at different layers of the process of creating digital content:  Developers can run automated checks as part of their continuous integration (CI) process  Everyone can look at the accessibility of a single page  Editors can be given accessibility issues within a WYSIWYG editor  Whole websites can now be regularly crawled for bugs  Designers can evaluate problems with contrast issues in their designsAll of this is now possible with a range of proprietary and open source tools. With the rapid development of automated testing, there are now multiple options to gather information on a single website—or an entire government.A guide to automated testingChecklist  Continuous Integration tests incorporate accessibility tools like axe and errors block commits.  Patterns and pages are regularly reviewed to see that they test patterns available to authors.  Site-wide scans are used to track errors over time and catch both common and weird issues.  Creators of digital content all have some browser extension to quickly evaluate page-level accessibility.Key questions  Are you using a variety of automated testing tools to help identify potential problems?  How are you ensuring that you aren&#39;t relying too heavily on automated tests?  Have automated processes been set up to optimize use of developer time?Use Deque&#39;s aXe toolDeque&#39;s aXe has changed the playing field for site reviews. Because of its flexible design, it can be executed from the command line, from within the browser, or even from a WYSIWYG editor. Being executed from the command line means that it is much easier to simply add accessibility checking to any scripts that are being run. It can be appended to a script crawling to ensure security best practices are maintained, or simply added to a continuous integration script.Axe also provides highly structured and easily actionable error reports. These empower entities to pinpoint and categorize issues—from alt text to problems with the symantec structure and missing language. Axe is also already incorporating elements of WCAG 2.1.The Axe accessibility engine is now built into Google&#39;s Lighthouse, Microsoft&#39;s Accessibility Insights, and a host of other projects. Axe can also be applied to the web, Android and Windows testing. This provides a huge amount of flexibility for most software development teams.Government Digital Services in both the United Kingdom and Singapore have leveraged Deque&#39;s open-source axe-core accessibility engine to create tools that crawl and gather accessibility barriers for both public-facing websites and internal web-based communications. Similar open-source accessibility engines have been built by IBM &amp;amp; Deque, and there are proprietary tools available from firms like WebAim, Tenon &amp;amp; Siteimprove.Automated testing caveatHowever, it is important to note that, no matter the tool, automated testing only catches about one third of accessibility issues, so it cannot be relied upon to determine if a site complies. To better ensure that their digital tools are accessible to keyboard-only and assistive technology users, automated tests need to be done along with a robust manual testing plan.CivicActions ApproachCurrently CivicActions uses the following approaches that are open source.Pa11y CIPa11y CI is a continuous integration (CI) runner that can test a few pages or an entire site for accessibility issues. Our projects include Pa11y CI in their CI pipelines and generate reports as artifacts or comments with the results of the testing.We are currently testing this accessibility site using Pa11y CI and we blogged about it here and on opensource.com.Pa11y by default uses the HTML_CodeSniffer accessibility engine, but it is recommended to switch to Pa11y with axe, which is described in this UK Government Accessibility Manual.Cypress testing with the axe coreCypress is a JavaScript testing framework that is used for automated testing. Axe core is a popular accessibility testing engine. Our projects use cypress with the axe core to test components for accessibility issues.Take a look at Setting up Cypress with axe for accessibility article that illustrates the setup.

Access Armada has some interesting suggestions on more strategic approaches to checklists. Ultimately though, regularly reviewing your checklists is important. They can be a powerful tool for teams to keep learning how to create more inclusive content.Microsoft&#39;s Accessibility Insights has both a FastPass and Assessment component. The Assessment component guides users through doing a manual review. Using this tool, organizations could:  Run the FastPass&#39;s automated axe checks on every page.  Check that the Tab stops follow a logical order when navigating with a keyboard.  Look over the elements that are marked Needs reviews to see if there are elements where a manual review can identify whether it is an issue or not.  Complete the rest of the assessment to ensure that the page meets WCAG requirements.This is a time consuming process, but would give the reviewer a high level of confidence that the site has good accessibility.One could also look to use a tool like WebAim&#39;s WAVE, ANDI, or Tota11y to scan a web page for errors. In which case a reviewer could do something like this:  Scan the page with the WAVE Toolbar:          Look for clear errors (red boxes with an X in them).      See if the alt text effectively describes the images on the page.      Ensure that there is sufficient color contrast.        Do keyboard only testing (using just tab, shift-tab, arrow keys &amp;amp; escape) to navigate the page.  Evaluate page for plain language using free tools like the HemingwayApp.  Magnify the page up to 200% and look for usability and readability issues.There are lots of checklists, rotating through a few of them will help give different people different things to think about accessibility:  W3C&#39;s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)  18F - USA Government  UK&#39;s Government Digital Services (GDS)  WebAim  Elsevier&#39;s WCAG 2.1 Checklist  A11yProject  Heydon Works  VoxMedia  PSU  Yale  University of Washington  tmobile&#39;s A11yEngineer  dev.to&#39;s Web Accessibility Cheat Sheet  The Book on Accessibility  Intopia&#39;s Accessibility Not-ChecklistChecklist  Have a checklist that builds on automated testing approaches.  Provide role-based checklists so that different people in the organization are focused on different aspects of accessibility.  Change your checklists so that new elements can be improved.  Ensure checklists are short and concise enough that they are used.Key questions  Are you making good use of the time and attention of your staff?  Are the checklists boring, or supporting your team?"

There is so much to learn, and digital accessibility best practices are constantly changing. There is no course or certificate that will give you access to everything your organization needs to be compliant with the law. It takes a community of people to work collectively to find or establish better practices for your website.You can find people interested in accessibility in whatever piece of the internet you are most comfortable using. There is a /accessibility subreddit or web-a11y Slack channel, but there are similar groups in Facebook and LinkedIN too. Most of these are open. If you are part of a software community like Drupal, there are likely many ways to engage with accessibility people in that space, like an #accessibility channel in whatever messaging platform is used.The UK&#39;s Government Digital Service has proven regular inter-agency leadership on accessibility in government. If you work for a government agency in the United Kingdom, you can join this group. They now have thousands of cross government accessibility community meetups and a Slack channel for government employees to talk about accessibility. They have gone so far as to build it into their Service Manual.In isolation it is difficult for any one individual to get accessibility right, and maintain it over time. It really is important to find ways that multiple people within an organization or across related organizations, can have a community to lean on.

Working virtually allows some people with disabilities to excel. Often people with physical disabilities face barriers in traditional office environments which may not be able to provide an accessible office or sufficient accommodations to participate equally. By using video conferencing, slack, email and other online collaboration tools, our team is able to use a more customized workspace at home, and skip the need to commute to a central office.Unfortunately, there are also people with disabilities which are excluded from participating in many distributed teams. Many deaf and hard of hearing people find it more difficult to read lips or intentions through video conferencing tools. Blind users are blocked by the many visual organization tools like Trello &amp;amp; Mural that do not have good support for blind users. Many websites do not have sufficient support for even keyboard only users.Fortunately, there are things that we can do to change this. Most popular video conferencing tools now offer AI driven speech to text captioning. This isn&#39;t perfect, but is continuing to improve. There is more pressure for visual kanban &amp;amp; sticky note tools to build in greater accessibility. More people are thinking about accessibility before buying IT for their office.Another approach that some organizations are doing is helping to assign a minder to help people with disabilities navigate systems that are not fully accessible. Often simply being able to DM a colleague to ensure that the message is understood properly can do a lot to reduce anxiety in the workforce.Resources  https://www.ryerson.ca/accessibility/guides-resources/virtual-meetings/.  https://www.nad.org/videoconferencing-platforms-feature-matrix/.  https://medium.com/cmcnally/accessibility-strategies-for-deaf-hard-of-hearing-people-in-remote-meetings-e19781b3bc4.  https://disabilityin.org/resources2/covid-19-response-accessible-tools-and-content/.  https://www.toolbox.com/hr/hr-strategy/articles/has-remote-work-increased-disability-inclusion-in-workplace/.  https://angel.co/blog/how-remote-work-impacts-employees-with-disabilities.  https://www.forumone.com/ideas/an-accessibility-inclusion-checklist-for-virtual-events/.  https://equalentry.com/slack-vs-discord-which-is-better-for-screen-readers/.  https://www.access-board.gov/about/meetings.html.  https://knowbility.org/blog/2021/welcoming-accessible-virtual-meetings/.Checklist  Ensure you have captions enabled in Zoom, Google Meet or Microsoft Teams.

Investing time to ensrue that the templates used to are accessible helps to reduce the overall level of effort. A good template will be built with good color contrast, clear font styles and sizes.Microsoft: To add a template in Word, Excel or Powerpoint  Click on &quot;Tools&quot;, then click &quot;Templates and add-ins&quot; from the dropdown menu.

See the playbooks on automated testing and manual testing for more information.When recruiting a testing cohort, it is important to consider the range of disabilities that need to be addressed. Should you test with people who were blind from birth and who use Braille, or those who became blind and use an audio interface? A legally blind person may have some sight, and may use a screen reader in combination with a screen magnifier. If there are audio components, it may be important to include members of the deaf community. People have a range of experiences of perceiving colour, and this can change over time. These are just a few examples.There are many different disabilities and people experiencing combinations of them. Depending on the size of the project you may want to adjust the number of participants who are involved. Most projects simply do not include enough people with disabilities. Remember too that there is variation in how people use Assistive Technology, and so one perspective may not reflect the needs of the whole community. A minimum size would include people with limitations in sight, hearing, mobility and cognition.Many disabilities are invisible, and because of the stigma that can be associated with disability, people may not feel comfortable disclosing this information to their peers. It is statistically likely that a team already includes people with disabilities, but often this is hidden and unknown to the rest of the group.Robust products and services are co-designed with the users. People with disabilities have expertise through lived experience that needs to be recognized, especially when building tools and services for them. &quot;Nothing About Us Without Us!&quot; is a common call in the disability movement, because all too often, people with disabilities are not engaged.

In an effort to grow the practice, the UK published a useful guide on writing accessibility statements that meet their requirements, and there are more approaches available in this repository. All USA Federal agencies must also include an accessibility statement, but the regulations are not as well defined.As the final piece of the feedback loop, accessibility statements ultimately determine how well your organization is meeting its accessibility goals. They can help people who simply have their systems configured differently than the testing infrastructure or those who have more unique requirements, and they make it clear that there is always more to do. Ultimately, the goal is improving the site for all users and encouraging visitors to be a part of that process.Checklist  Appears in the footer of every page of the website.

Is there anything about PDFs or other digital content which is generally inaccessible?Key questions  What happens with messages (phone calls or emails) with errors that are submitted via the accessibility statement?  Is it being reviewed regularly to see that it is still relevant for the site and it&#39;s users?  Are extra efforts made to ensure that the accessibility page is accessible?

        "content"  : "Many government staff have not received adequate (or any) accessibility-specific training. Even as there are many resources available there is generally a lack of awareness—but when people find these resources they are often quick to take advantage. For example, when the UK&#39;s Government Digital Services (GDS) offered a free course on content design through Future Learn, over 10 thousand people signed up.Some of our favorite, free accessibility courses include:  Web Accessibility by Google;  Digital Accessibility Foundations by the W3C;  Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Accessibility by GeorgiaTech;  Assistive technologies and online learning by the Open University.Podcasts are another great way to learn about web accessibility—including A11yRules.com and Human Potential At Work. While these resources are often available for free, the publishers usually depend on donations to support the ongoing education work. If you choose to listen, please consider contributing to a Patreon campaign to support their wonderful work. Supporting these initiatives is a cost-effective way to increase the availability of new accessibility resources.There are also several high-quality accessibility guides available for free. For example, the US government has produced a guide with 18F. Rather than creating a new guide from scratch, these resources are available to build upon and improve. CivicActions is looking to extend these to provide an accessibility playbook for people interested in accessibility best practices.Public sector employees must be encouraged to take advantage of these resources to best serve their constituents. Accessibility best practices change quickly, so it is important to invest in a sustainable accessibility training program. The Section508.gov&#39;s Technology Accessibility Playbook includes a play on educating the workforce.Checklist  Schedule time to participate in Global Accessibility Awareness Day and International Day of People With Disabilities (Dec 3rd).  Follow more accessibility people/organizations on Social Media.  Read and share books on accessibility best practices.  Subscribe to free accessibility videos &amp;amp; podcasts.  Ensure key staff are regularly taking new training courses like Web.dev&#39;s Learn Accessibility.Key questions  What are you doing to help keep up-to-date with the latest best practices?  Where can we learn from adjacent disciplines to learn how to improve accessibility of the product/services that you work with.  Are there new assistive technologies that are worth learning about?  How are new people in the organization brought in and educated about accessibility?"

        "content"  : "Building an accessible culture through our Champions ProgramCivicActions created our Accessibility Pledge to help us keep a focus on delivering inclusive digital services. We knew that a handful of accessibility experts wouldn&#39;t be sufficient to deliver on this pledge, so we created this program.Accessibility Champions at CivicActions are known as &quot;Champions&quot; (ACs). Champions are responsible for fostering awareness and action on digital accessibility. We have ACs on both client teams (VA, WeCMS, etc.) and in functional teams (other practice areas). Larger projects may choose to have multiple ACs to support different sites/applications. ACs are a conduit of information from the Accessibility Practice Area to their functional and/or client teams. They also support bringing concerns and findings from their functional and/or client teams to the Accessibility Practice Area. Our Champions support their team(s) in building accessibility confidence. The AC is a support role, and it is assumed that anyone can bring their concerns to the attention of the Accessibility Practice Area. Project managers are responsible for ensuring that each of their teams has an accessibility champion. Ideally teams would find folks willing to volunteer for this role.Objectives of the Accessibility Practice AreaWe are building a program in which:  Everyone gets oriented to basic accessibility with their orientation so that it is a part of the culture. This is already part of our onboarding.  Key teams build on this basic orientation to ensure that new staff understand accessibility for their functional role. This may also be useful for some client teams.  Regular engagement or reminders about the opportunities for accessibility certification and study groups to help support learning.  Each functional team selects a Champion who is also an active part of the accessibility practice area. The person selected should:          Be engaged in helping their functional role have a clear understanding of accessibility expectations for that role.      Update the related content on the CivicActions accessibility site.      Support onboarding new members of that functional team.        Each client team has selected at least one Champion who is also an active part of the accessibility practice area.Champion levelsAs champions gain skills, experience, and responsibility they can advance through three levels:Level 1 — Basic knowledgeAttend the practice area calls and engage in the Slack channel / keep up with best practices discussed there. Members active for 3 months get a CA11y T-Shirt. New employees are encouraged to sign up after their first 90 days.  Page level  Identify common problems  Professional Development (Prodev)  Take EdX course (with certificate)All CivicActions employees are encouraged to get the EdX Certification. The course is free, but the certification costs $99. Staff can use their Profesional Development (ProDev) to pay for the certificate. New staff can get access early access to their ProDev funds to pay for this certificte. It is estimated to take 16-20 hours over a period of 1 to 4 weeks.Level 2 — ExperiencedEither Certified or presently working to become certified through the IAAP a Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies(CPACC) or Web Accessibility Specialist(WAS) or a DHS Trusted Tester Certified. Contribute to the website, contribute to articles or lead Onboarding Workshops. Bio added to the accessibility site.  Task level  Recommend solutions with confidence  Professional Development (Prodev)  IAAP (CPACC or WAS)  DHS 508 Trusted Tester programLevel 3 — Taking leadershipDevelops and innovates our Accessibility Practice Area. Has 10% of time reserved for accessibility initiatives in CivicActions. Expected to track down &amp;amp; advance issues. Get financial support to buy commercial software like axe DevTools Pro or ARC Tool. Having both WAS &amp;amp; CPACC certified and becoming a Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA).  Systems level  Prioritize approaches which will have the biggest impact  Professional Development (Prodev)  Attending accessibility conferences  Example initiatives  Maintaining modules or themes  Contributing back to the USWDS, CMS Design System or VA Design System  Engagement with the W3C Working Groups  Coaching clients or partnersAreas of focusChampions will come in all sizes and shapes, and it is expected that there will be differences in the needs that functional and client teams have. Teams may decide that they need to have people with more or less experience to lead. Most teams will probably just have one, but some may have more, particularly if there is mentoring or a distribution of labor involved.The levels are primarily set up to encourage people to push themselves to learn more. There is an infinite amount that can be done on accessibility. It is beneficial for CivicActions to have people who have certifications which we can include in proposals. It takes time and effort to maintain some certificates. It is good to do this, but you should be able to be a champion without certifications.ExpectationsA champion will…  Take responsibility for iteratively making their project more accessible  Recommend process, tooling or other changes to make accessibility a bigger part of the project growth  Work with the Accessibility Practice Area group to surface and codify best practices to share across the company  Raising accessibility issues in team meetings  Surfacing opportunities for learning and process improvement during project sprint retrospectivesSpecific examples include:  Audit their project for areas for improvement  Ensuring there is axe-core testing in our CI/CD process (pa11y with axe, Cypress-axe).  Ensure developers are using an accessibility linter (VSCode, phpStorm, atom)  Ensuring designers include Figma accessibility annotation (wireframes)  Working with the project team/PMs to better integrate accessibility into ticketing process  Building checklists or default acceptance criteria  Do accessibility code reviews and help coach others on the team  Leading ARRM workshops if useful for new project or addressing backlogsInterest in  Learning more about digital accessibility  Research and investigation  Ability to describe barriers in a way that allows them to be reproduced  Coaching and mentoring  Complex problem solving  Presenting to audiences  Relationship building  Conflict resolution  Understanding the systems that create barriers to participation  Learning to use automated tools like WAVE &amp;amp; Accessibility Insights  Understanding how to interpret the results of automated toolsQualities: Motivating, self-directed, bias towards action, self and team awareness,Values: Collaboration, listening, empathy, perseverance, resilience, adaptability, transparency, attention to detail, ownership, accountability.Possible perk  T-Shirts or other swag  EdX Intro to Accessibility course with certificate  Axe DevTools Pro - Free if working on VA or US  Additional ProDev for accessibility-related training or IAAP Certifications  1st attempt at IAAP certification for WAS and CPACC  IAAP Membership  Recognized official project role  Designated time for experimentation and development  Support in writing blog posts  Speaking opportunities at conferences and webinarsBudgetary considerationsLevel 1  T-Shirt &amp;amp; EdX CertificateLevel 2  IAAP prep course and certification exam  Recertification every 3 yearsLevel 3  IAAP Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA)  Recertification every 3 years  IAAP membership  Axe DevTools ProResponsibilities  You are not expected to be an accessibility expert.FAQsHow do you advance between AC levels?Everyone is encouraged to become a Level 1 Champion. To participate in our meetings, engage in Slack and come to our events. People who are interested in advancing their knowledge should talk with Level 2 or 3 Champions about next steps. Anyone can use their ProDev to participate in certifications, but we would like to support those who are interested in starting the process. Level 3 Champions will require negotiations with their manager as there are time and budget implications. The Accessibility Lead will support negotiations as it is important to support those who have demonstrated leadership in this area.Should there be checklists for each team?We have defined some role-based checklists in the CivicActions Accessibility Site. Checklists can be a powerful tool if used right, we have tried to provide some guidance on this. As part of building a best practice for a functional or client team, it can be useful to help at least guide expectations and support onboarding new staff.Why should I invest in becoming a Champion?Many joined CivicActions because they wanted to work for an impact-driven organization. Helping make websites more accessible can have a huge impact on millions of people. We also want to support people in their growth within the company. Being able to be a IAAP Certified Level 3 Champion looks good on your resume. It will help CivicActions win work, and help us all to understand how understanding people better will help us become better innovators.Metrics for Champions  Variety of best practices or frameworks to evaluate a project on beyond the WCAG guidelines  Customizable checklists for how to evaluate an existing project, individual pages, and critical user paths.  Customizable checklists to ensure a new project is thinking about accessibility throughout the project and where and how often progress should be reported to the client, the Accessibility working group, CA  User pathways for critical tasks and impacts on personas with barriers (permanent, temporary or situational).Note: if pathways haven&#39;t been defined in a project, the accessibility champion should advocate for them to be defined.  Some additional ideas for metrics:          Content design - Reading level improvements and increased use of plain language.      UX design - These should be comparable between someone with a disability as someone without a disability: time to complete key tasks, completion rate, digital uptake or adoption rate, error rate, user satisfaction; running a certain percentage of user tests with users with a disability.      Engineering - number of axe-errors in client sites - Purple Hats grade: A.      Project Management - introduction in official ceremonies as appropriate.      DevOps - Pa11y tests for sample content types, views, web forms and landing pages. Cypress-axe tests for interactive elements.

This is usually associated with videos, to display real time textual equivalent of speech. Sometimes this moves beyond speech to include other sounds relevant to the video.Content (vs. presentation)The separation of concerns design principle as applied to the authoring and presentation of content. The two should be independent to see that the two are distinct and can be managed independently.Content management system (CMS)CMS is a software application used to oversee the operation of web information. Common CMS applications include software like WordPress and Drupal.ContrastContrast is the perceived difference between two adjacent colours. Two colours from different segments of the colour wheel are contrasting colours.

This act has implications for federal assistance and accommodation in the workplace. If an organization receives federal support of any kind, even if the organization is not a federal or state organization, the organization must comply with Section 504.Section 508Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Until the Section 508 Refresh, this requirement was based on best practices of 1998.Section 508 RefreshThe Refresh brought the guidelines for the USA to be essentially the same as WCAG 2.0 AA.Semantic markupSemantic Markup is the idea of creating more meaning with the information in web pages and web applications. This makes it easier for devices to understand what each aspect of the code means for the end user. HTML5 markup has been optimized to allow developers to create more semantic markup.StyleStyle is what you see visually on a page, implemented with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).TranscriptA text only version of what&#39;s said in a movie or television program; they are not real time and they generally are limited to speech only; they are not a recommended substitute for captions.UsabilityThe principle that information and applications should not only be accessible but also easy to use and understand.User agentThe generic term used to describe any device which might access a webpage.Visual focusWhere the user&#39;s focus is on a Web page. Different browsers&#39; default focus styles may vary, and continue to be altered as browsers change.Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT™)A static document that describes how software, hardware, electronic content, and support documentation meet accessibility requirements. Generally this is aligned with the WCAG standard. VPAT™&#39;s are defined by an industry association, Information Technology Industry Council. VPATs often required in procurement to help buyers understand how accessible a product might be and help to discover deficiencies. These are often more about marketing than reflecting the actual accessibility barriers in the product or service.WCAG 2.* (WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2,1, WCAG 2.2) {#wcag-2-*-wcag-2-0-wcag-2-1-wcag-2-2}The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 is focused on providing an international technical standard for web content. It has 12 guidelines that are organized under four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (ie. POUR). The guidelines each have a testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA.WCAG 3.0The WCAG Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0.WidgetA widget is a small application installed and used on websites. Each widget has a varying amount of purposes. An example of a widget is a small, email newsletter signup form, or a third-party live chat functionality."

        "content"  : "A brief history of digital accessibility.Digital accessibility basicsDigital accessibility is both complicated and simple. It is complicated because there are many layers of technology involved in communicating content from an author to the user. It is simple because, ultimately, if you keep your site simple and follow some basic guidelines, you&#39;re generally going to achieve digital accessibility.Section 508The United States first led the movement to articulate web accessibility with the creation of Section 508 in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In 1998, the U.S. legislature corrected the shortcomings of the original Section 508 Amendment. This included a list of technical standards against which products can be evaluated to determine if they meet the technical compliance.WCAG and POURIn 1999 the World Wide Web Consortium&#39;s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 were published. The guidelines were built to be technology-agnostic—HTML was just one way to structure content on the web—and to accommodate the rapid pace of change online.For example, when the first iPhone was released in 2007, people had no idea how much mobile devices would revolutionize how people interact—both with digital content and each other. The web has continued to evolve rapidly. It is clear that nobody wants to create an app or a website that makes someone physically ill, but how much animation is acceptable? Where is the line between visual changes that help people identify where new content is, and the changes that cause some people to become sick?Additionally, since the WCAG process requires a great deal of negotiation—the standards must be based on evidence-based rules that have broad applicability—it isn&#39;t feasible to make specific guidelines for every disability. There are even occasions where designing a site for one type of disability (say, low vision users) will conflict with another disability (say, people with dyslexia).Rather than guidelines based on specific accommodations for particular disabilities, the W3C&#39;s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) settled on four key principles—known by the acronym POUR—which have guided digital accessibility. To be accessible, digital content must be:  Perceivable: users must be able to perceive the information being presented  Operable: users must be able to operate the interface  Understandable: users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface  Robust: users must be able to access the content as technologies advanceAs the web continues to change and develop, the guidelines to maintain accessibility need to as well. WCAG 2.0 was released in 2008, 2.1 was released in 2018, and 2.2 is slated for release in mid-2021. There may be other releases within the WCAG 2.x series, and the WAI has released the first draft of WCAG 3.0, which is working to revise the whole framework.In the near future, digital tools will be expected to be personalized so that every individual can maximize their use. And while digital accessibility continues to develop, it is clear that government bodies must invest to make their technology more accessible today than before.To be clear, no website will be 100% accessible. Any work that is done should strive for excellence, not perfection. Even a site that met WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance would not necessarily be accessible to everyone. Like security, accessibility is a journey where improvements must be constantly adapted to meet changing realities. Organizations must seek to be better today than they were yesterday.WCAG guidelines should be seen not as the goal to strive for, but a floor from which to build.Other governments around the world began implementing accessibility regulations. In Canada there was the Accessible Canada Act (ACA) and also several provincial acts like Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). Accessibility legislation occurs at all levels of government, and although there may be differences, web standards usually follow the WCAG recommendations.Harmonised European Standard &amp;amp; European Accessibility ActEurope is currently seen as the leader in digital accessibility best practices. The Harmonised European Standard (EN 301 549) is a living document first published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in 2014. The latest version, 3.1.1, was published in November 2019 and embraces WCAG 2.1 AA as the minimum accessibility standard for countries in the EU. Governments in the EU are given the freedom to choose how they want to implement the standard within their own countries, and after the W3C releases WCAG 2.2, it will be reviewed for consideration for an upcoming release of EN 301 549.Web content makes up a lot of the material covered in the standard, but it also includes:  computers, smartphones, tablets and TV sets;  banking ATM and services, and payment terminals;  e-books and e-readers;  mobile apps and ticketing machines.Aligning with EN 301 549 means that government accessibility efforts evolve with an ever-changing internet. Since its creation, EN 301 549 has been embraced by the UK, Mexico and Australia, and will continue to be adopted around the world. There will be costs to adopting the standard, but doing so will make it easier for companies to trade on a global stage.In 2016, the European Union (EU) Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed the EU Web Accessibility Directive. The directive aims to ensure that all Europeans can take a full and active part in the digital economy and society. EU Member states had until 2018 to adapt the Directive into national law.In 2019, the EU formally adopted the European Accessibility Act (EAA) to create a common set of accessibility guidelines for member states. When it comes into effect in 2025, the EAA will apply to businesses as well as governments across the EU—any product or service that is sold for use within the Eurozone will need to comply, including the full range of digital tools. This will include any foreign businesses that work with EU member states.The goal of the EAA is to provide unrestricted access to people experiencing any form of disability and ensure that all EU citizens can access information and services through websites, mobile applications, and electronic devices.European monitoring requirementsBy December 23, 2021, all EU member states will be required to monitor the accessibility of their public-facing websites and report on progress over time. It will be up to member states to determine how this is done, but some of them will certainly leverage open source tools to aggregate national results.In the UK, the Government Digital Services (GDS) is playing the role of the central monitoring team to assess public websites and apps. This monitoring is designed to encourage the public sector to make timely improvements to accessibility. The hope is that with active engagement with various departments, the government can avoid the need to implement further enforcement. The GDS team isn&#39;t sampling all government sites, but is prioritizing those which threaten to exclude the most people, or where there are known or suspected problems. Like others in Europe, the UK has implemented Accessibility Statements into its standard web pages so that citizens are encouraged to submit feedback when they run into barriers. This feedback loop empowers the public and highlights barriers that have been missed by automated and manual testing.In the UK, by the time a website reaches a public beta it must have monitoring in place to identify potential problems. While the monitoring instructions don&#39;t specifically state accessibility, the GDS is actively building tools to make it easier to incorporate, including a site crawler that runs on an open-source accessibility engine built by Deque Systems, called Axe."

        "content"  : "OverviewYou worked hard getting your content online. How do you make sure your readers can find, understand and use it? Apply plain language. Clear and direct writing makes your content accessible (it&#39;s also the law!). Plain language also helps people with different cognitive abilities. Or speakers of a non-English language. Or those who rely on audio to listen to text. You might also be writing for the public. Or a group of experts. Either way, your audience&#39;s reading level is likely lower than you think.Who this is for  CivicActions employees  Public servants  Government communications teams  Anyone designing content for the publicA quick guide to plain languageKeep it simpleAvoid:  Jargon and government legalese. If you have to use an acronym, spell it out first.  Filler words. For example, use the word &#39;analyze&#39; not &#39;conduct an analysis&#39;.  Repetitive words  Irony or idioms  Intro text. For example, &quot;Welcome to our department homepage.&quot;Try:  Using active voice throughout your site  Writing one idea per sentence  Using the simpler synonym. For example, &#39;use&#39; not &#39;utilize&#39;.  Keeping the reading level between 6th and 8th grade reading level. Remember to remove proper nouns and titles.Write for your audienceBefore writing, ask yourself: What are your reader&#39;s needs? What do they need to know or do after reading your content?Make it actionablePeople visit your website to do something: answer a question or complete a specific task. Ask yourself: what are the top questions my target reader wants to know? How can I answer it quickly?Choose words your reader usesImagine you&#39;re talking to your reader over the phone. What words would you use to answer questions directly? You can also use different keyword research tools. Try Google&#39;s Keyword Research Planner or Moz Analytics. They can help you brainstorm user-friendly words and phrases related to your topic.Make it scannableStructure your content with clear headers. Present headers in a logical order. This will help a user scan the content easily to figure out what it&#39;s about. Make it specific to the topic or sub-topic. The clearest headers tell you something useful. Use bulleted lists to make content easy to scan. Remember: website users don&#39;t read, they scan. They often leave web pages within 10 to 20 seconds.Test your content with a readability toolAlways run your content through a readability tool. You can use Hemingway App, Readable.io, or turn on Flesch-Kincaid if editing in Microsoft Word. Try to get the reading grade level lower than 8th grade. Before using the tool, remember to remove:  proper nouns  titles  any domain-specific language you have to use. For example, a medical term you might need to include in your content.Listen to your text in Reader ModeThere are many tools to help with the readability of your site. Some of them offer a text to speach functionality that makes it easy for people to listen to what you have written. In our testing, Microsoft&#39;s Immersive Reader is one of the best.Simply hearing how text read out loud can help authors better understand where improvements can be made.Do more &quot;just enough&quot; user testing with your audienceSee &quot;just enough&quot; article.Automated readability tools won&#39;t catch everything. You&#39;ll need to test your content with humans too. You can test:  Menu labels and micro-content. Keep your user goals in mind.  Language. Ask your users to read your content out loud. What words do they stumble over? How do they rate the clarity of the language (on a scale from 1 to 5)?  Understanding. Ask your users to paraphrase what they read. What did they summarize correctly? What did they miss? What did they get wrong?Join a plain language community  Digital.gov Plain Language Action and Information Network. They promote plain language in all government communications.
